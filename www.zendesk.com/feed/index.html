				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the need for customer service professionals to provide excellent customer experience expands, retailers must empower them with new tools and technologies. Generating data is only one piece of the puzzle—deriving insight from that data, and sharing it quickly and seamlessly with customer service agents is key. </p>
<p>Better dashboards deliver personalized experiences that make a difference. According to a recent IDC survey, retailers are bullish on the opportunities offered by data visualization tools and dashboards on mobile devices—with half of retailers surveyed seeing them as having a “significant impact.” Coupled with customized metrics and KPI’s, these tools could greatly improve call center operations, workflow, and associate management. </p>
<p>Business collaboration tools will also play an increasing role, and retailers who want to get the most from their tools will ensure the quality of their data by adopting plug and play connectors for social, other external and enterprise data.</p>

As more and more customers expect support via live chat, it’s important for businesses to not only juggle live chats, but exceed chat expectations, whether it be via web or mobile]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine you’re juggling—you’re doing just fine with three balls, but then someone throws in a fourth, and then a fifth. Pretty soon you’re trying to keep seven multicolored balls going, and a blurry rainbow begins to form before your eyes. You miss a beat and all seven balls crash to the ground. Now imagine attempting to juggle seven different chats in real-time, where speed and efficiency are imperative. Things can get messy quickly and missing a beat (or a chat request) can lead to upset customers. </p>
<p>Most customers prefer chat to email—why wait for a response via email when a question can be answered within minutes on live chat? As more and more customers expect support via live chat, it’s important for businesses to not only juggle live chats, but exceed chat expectations, whether it be via web or mobile. </p>
<p>Here’s how you can make the most out of live chat:</p>
<p><strong>Declutter your workflow</strong><br />
With customers reaching out across multiple channels it can be difficult to keep track of all your conversations, deliver quality service, and still grow your business. It’s crucial to have a system that organizes channels like live chat and keeps track of every request or query that comes in. That way you don’t have to worry about losing a customer in the shuffle. Managing web, mobile, and in-app channels might seem daunting, but the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/chat/" target="_blank">Zendesk Chat</a> and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/" target="_blank">Zendesk Support</a> integration puts all your customer conversations in one place; you can easily switch between all your channels, including chat, phone, messaging, and email to offer uninterrupted support on the channels your customers prefer. </p>
<p><strong>Be mobile ready</strong><br />
Customers use mobile more than ever to reach out for support. By adding live chat to your mobile app, you can meet your customers wherever they happen to be—whether they’re at dinner, the gym, or mid-grocery run. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/foodpanda/" target="_blank">Foodpanda</a> recently launched Zendesk Chat support via their mobile application. Using Zendesk’s developer-friendly Mobile SDK to integrate chat, Foodpanda was able to keep their customers in the native app and product experience and offer a seamless support experience. Mobile users can receive the same great support they experience online. </p>
<p><strong>Proactively engage</strong><br />
<img src="https://zen-marketing-content.s3.amazonaws.com/content/blog/1_In%20text%20images/Online%20shopping%20statistic%20blog.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
When <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/61991-83-of-online-shoppers-need-support-to-complete-a-purchase-stats" target="_blank">83% of online shoppers need support to complete a purchase</a>, it’s important to consider proactive customer engagement.  Live chat gives your company a chance to reach out to customers first, so you can head off potential problems that might contribute to customer churn. It also enables you to get more personal with your customers and reach out with things they actually care about. With Chat, you can see the pages your website visitors browse and then proactively reach out when you sense they might be having trouble; no more shots in the dark. You can also automate the process by using proactive triggers that target customers who are stuck on specific pages, like the checkout page. </p>
<p><strong>Make an impression </strong><br />
More often than not, appearances matter. It’s important to be able to do your thing, let your colors fly—whatever it takes to get your brand on your chat widget so your customers know who they’re talking to. With Chat customization options like layouts and themes, you can create a unique chat experience for your customers and leave an indelible impression.  </p>
<p><strong>Analyze chat and agent activity</strong><br />
Analytics are crucial for better understanding your customers. Live chat offers an opportunity to gain insight into trends so you can anticipate customer needs and better serve your customers. Wondering <a href="https://chat.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/234980227-Analytics-101-Premium-" target="_blank">why your company’s live chat wait times have gone up, or why your CSAT has dipped</a>? Zendesk Chat overlays metrics like missed chats versus wait times, or chats served versus customer satisfaction, instead of just giving raw data, to better spot trends and improve your support organization. Chat also allows you to monitor live data on agent productivity and performance, so you can make informed decisions on things like staffing and assignment.</p>
<p>It’s crucial for customers to be able to reach your business in real time, and across multiple channels, including web, mobile, or in-app. Live chat can seem daunting, but with the right software, you don’t have to worry about juggling acts, or dropping the ball on your customers. Instead, you can focus on crafting a unique, seamless experience for everyone that interacts with your business. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disjointed data too often means a disjointed customer experience. Many retailers are struggling to get by with home-grown tools that don’t track the right data or offer relevant insight into customer satisfaction or experience. Customer service must harness the power of emerging tools to meet consumer expectations of outstanding customer service. Measuring and managing the customer experience across multiple channels is critical if you want to build successful customer relationships. </p>
<p>To offer the best to your customers, you need the right tools and analytics. A recent global survey by IDC sheds light on how customer service impacts every retailer’s bottom line. The findings reinforce the importance of utilizing the right technology tools to provide excellent customer service. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you don&#8217;t measure the entire integrated experience you won&#8217;t know if you are delivering it and won’t be able to improve. Retailers must adopt an integrated system that organizes metrics in a way that supports a cohesive experience. Capturing and managing customer data is just the first step: the key to success is gaining insights quickly and getting that information out to your service reps quickly, in a way they can understand, across multiple channels.</p>
<p>Simply put, to compete in today’s marketplace, retailers need to make customer data available to their agents in an easy, consumable way so they can serve their customers better than the competition.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence—the mere words bring on a myriad of conflicting emotions. Images of <em>The Matrix</em> swim before your eyes. That is until you remember how helpful Siri is when you can’t put your finger on the name of a song on the radio. </p>
<p>“Hey, Siri. What’s this song?”</p>
<p>“You seem to be listening to ‘Come On Eileen’ by Dexy’s Midnight Runners, but don’t ask me to sing it.” </p>
<p>Aside from the fact that you should probably know this song, Siri is both useful and playful, no doubt. </p>
<p>It’s not a new topic of contention, but artificial intelligence (AI) is more relevant than ever. More and more businesses are using AI to provide better services to customers, similar to Apple’s Siri. According to Gartner, “Artificial intelligence (AI), a topic of interest for over 20 years, is at last finding a rapid uptake as a tool to provide better customer service.” The future of AI can seem scary, but businesses can harness the power of AI to deliver better customer support and to treat customers more like humans. </p>
<p><strong>If you’re curious to learn about the future of AI and how your business can use it to deliver excellent customer service, we’re hosting<a href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/gartner-predicts-2017-crm-customer-service-support/" target="_blank"> Gartner’s Predicts 2017: CRM Customer Service and Support </a>report for a limited time. </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2014, Zendesk officially launched Link-SF, a collaboration between Zendesk and a local non-profit, the <a href="http://www.tenderlointechnologylab.org/" title="St. Anthony Foundation’s Tenderloin Technology Lab" target="_blank">St. Anthony Foundation’s Tenderloin Technology Lab</a>. Link-SF is a mobile-first web app that connects needy members of the community with services and resources such as food, shelter, and medical aid. This allows individuals to find critical resources on their own at anytime, without dependence on a case manager, social worker, or other service provider.</p>
<p><img style="width: 40%; margin-right: 22px;" alt="LinkSF1" src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/blog/LinkSF2.jpg" /></p>
<p><a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/blog/link-sf-open-referral" title="Last year" target="_blank">Last year</a> we announced a partnership with <a href="https://openreferral.org/" title="Open Referral" target="_blank">Open Referral,</a> whose mission is to standardize civic services data across geographic regions. With this standardization, referral portals such as Link-SF can share data with each other, which decreases the amount of work duplication to maintain resource information. To that end, we are happy to announce that our latest version of the project consumes data that is very close in structure to Open Referral’s exemplary API, the Ohana API. </p>
<p>The new version of Link-SF received a couple of small style updates as well, while adhering to the principles gleaned in our user testing from 2013-2014, with our sole aim being usability among the underserved population in our communities. </p>
<p><img style="width: 40%; margin-right: 22px;" alt="LinkSF1" src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/LinkSF1.jpg" /></p>
<p>The project is still open-source, (visit: <a href="https://github.com/zendesk/linksf" title="https://github.com/zendesk/linksf" target="_blank">https://github.com/zendesk/linksf</a>) where it can can be adapted and deployed in cities all over the world. Our goal is to provide a solution which can be easily set up in days, using technology to create easier access to crucial services and helpful information for those in need. Take a look at <a href="http://www.link-sf.com/" target="_blank">our city’s version of the app</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Shopify's Director of Technical Support, Chris Wilson, tells Shopify's Zendesk story in his own words]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Editor’s note: We received this great note from Chris at Shopify, which he kindly let us publish. Suffice to say, we’re a fan of customer love letters, and this one gave us the warm fuzzies. Thank you, Chris and Shopify!</em></p>
<p>Relationships are tough.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, Shopify was in the midst of a rocky relationship with a partner that wasn&#8217;t working out. We’d spent a bit of time getting to know our first ticketing system; we were young, forgiving, and loved each other. Things were going well, but then we started to grow at different paces and we leaped ahead of our partner. We started talking about where our ticketing system wasn&#8217;t working—we needed speed, reporting, APIs, and advice. Our partner just wasn’t ready for that yet. And so we decided it was time to take a break and to re-evaluate what we wanted.</p>
<p>We needed someone who would grow with us, understand us, challenge us, and partner with us to achieve new heights. So we updated our status from ‘In a relationship’ to ‘Single’, opened up our dating app, and started swiping. A few hits came back, but nothing too promising. Nothing, that is, until a profile popped up that read: <em>I enjoy listening, conversations, connecting people to those that matter most, and keeping things beautifully simple.</em> We super liked that profile and a match was made. So begins an adventure.</p>
<p>Our relationship with Zendesk began when we were in one of our darkest periods. Shopify was hitting hypergrowth mode and we were doing everything we could to stay afloat. We were hiring at a breakneck pace, trying to onboard Gurus (our customer support staff) faster than we’d ever done before, while keeping the plane in flight. Our tools were in shambles, as we’d never expected this type of growth in such a short time. This meant Gurus were getting frustrated because our tools were slowing them down, onboarding was challenging, and helping customers was becoming difficult. Instead of our tools being simple, almost invisible, the tools were impeding their ability to have conversations and, worst of all, frustrating our customers. It was bad.</p>
<p>That’s where we started. Now let’s look at what we&#8217;ve done together. We grew from 20 Gurus to over 500. We went from being in one room to being distributed at home across Canada and Ireland. Our merchant count grew from 20,000 to 325,000. Our volume went from hundreds of conversations a day into the ten thousands, and we grew to offer 24/7/365 support. At the heart of all those milestones, you, Zendesk, were with us. You&#8217;ve grown with us, connected us, listened to our challenges, questioned our thinking, and offered advice. You brought us together with other customers and allowed us to share our successes, failures, and challenges. We’ve been able to learn from you and teach dozens of others about our approach to support. Through that, relationships have formed that will outlast careers. The magic comes from your beautifully simple software and your ability to build and foster relationships. For this reason, we truly believe you’re partners in this with us, and not simply a vendor selling us software.</p>
<p>What will the future bring us? New channels, new tools, and new strategies, but at the end of the day, it’s all about people and relationships. We’re both just getting started and I’m looking forward to what the future brings.</p>
