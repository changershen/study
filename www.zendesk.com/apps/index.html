<h3>Support Versions</h3>
<p>This version supports Atlassian JIRA Cloud and JIRA Server 7.0 and above. If you are using JIRA 6.x, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/jira-legacy/">use this version instead</a></p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>This App will be automatically installed and configured when installing the Zendesk Support add-on on JIRA. You are not required to manually install it.</p>
<p>You must have administrator permissions in both JIRA and Zendesk Support to set up the integration. When using JIRA Server, we recommend creating a dedicated user for the integration.The complete installation instructions can be found in here.</p>
<ol>
<li>In JIRA, select Add-ons from the Administration menu in the upper-right corner of the page.</li>
<li>Search for the add-on &#39;Zendesk for JIRA&#39; in the Atlassian Marketplace and then click Install on the right side.</li>
<li>After installing the add-on, return to the Administration page and select Add-ons &gt; Manage add-ons &gt; Zendesk for JIRA.</li>
<li>Click Configure, enter your Zendesk Support subdomain, and click Authenticate with Zendesk.</li>
<li>Select the ticket details that you want to display in linked JIRA issues.</li>
<li>Click Complete Set-up and Install App. After confirming that you want to proceed with the installation, the add-on installs an app in Zendesk to support the integration.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s it. Your teams can start collaborating using Zendesk Support and JIRA. To find out how, see Using the JIRA integration.
You can also read complete installation instructions here: <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/entries/40075496">Using the JIRA integration</a>.</p>

Guru provides lightning fast search, and can also automatically surface relevant content, such as product or category specific FAQ\u2019s and troubleshooting guides, directly within your agent\u2019s workflow based on the specific ticket or chat session currently open. \r\n\r\nUnlike knowledge portals or wikis where content is not easily located or has gone stale, our verification engine proactively reminds experts on your team to update content. So as you release new product updates and features, your entire team is prepared and confident in their ability to resolve issues for your customers. When agents trust that their knowledge base is up-to-date, they provide better support by reducing the # of calls and consistent responses across your entire support team. \r\n\r\nYour agents will love how quickly they can get up to speed and be prepared for every call with consistent, accurate and easily accessible information. Search faster and support better with Guru.","installation_instructions":"<p>To enable your agents one-click access to your trouble-shooting guides, internal-only FAQs, internal processes &amp; escalation procedures, simply click on the following link - https:\/\/www.getguru.com\/solutions\/support\/ and click on &quot;Get Started for Free&quot;! <\/p>\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve accessed Guru\u2019s Web App and installed our Extension on your preferred web browser, we can:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Automatically populate our recommended internal knowledge base framework <\/li>\n<li>Migrate content from your pre-existing Wiki, Google Sites, and\/or other internal knowledge repository into Guru <\/li>\n<li>Provide instructions in how to integrate your Guru internal knowledge base to your Zendesk search, tickets, tags, etc. via Guru Context! <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Have any questions?

As a result, the speed of moving data is fast, and accuracy guaranteed.","installation_instructions":"<p>Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.import2.com\/zendesk\/new?utm_source=vendor_links&amp;utm_medium=zendesk&amp;utm_campaign=zendesk\">www.import2.com\/zendesk<\/a> to start a sample migration.<\/p>\n","raw_installation_instructions":"Go to [www.import2.com\/zendesk](https:\/\/www.import2.com\/zendesk\/new?utm_source=vendor_links&utm_medium=zendesk&utm_campaign=zendesk) to start a sample migration.","small_icon":"\/api\/v2\/apps\/29455\/assets\/logo-small.png","large_icon":"\/api\/v2\/apps\/29455\/assets\/logo.png","screenshots":["\/api\/v2\/apps\/29455\/assets\/screenshot-0.png"],"visibility":"public","installable":false,"created_at":"2014-04-18T18:11:27Z","updated_at":"2014-12-01T22:08:13Z","framework_version":"","featured":false,"promoted":false,"products":["support"],"categories":[{"id":42,"name":"IT & Project Management"},{"id":24,"name":"Knowledge & Content"}],"version":null,"marketing_only":true,"deprecated":false,"obsolete":false,"paid":false,"rating":"stars-","feature_color":"#9e9e9e","google_analytics_code":null,"parameters":[],"plans":[],"name_clean":"import2","url":"\/apps\/import2\/","cats":"it-project-management knowledge-content","num_ratings":0,"cost":"FREE","trigger":"Install","icon_url":"https:\/\/d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net\/images\/p-apps-marketplace\/apps\/29455\/logo.png","created":1397844687},{"id":1409,"owner_id":1,"name":"Inbenta","single_install":false,"default_locale":"en","author_name":"Inbenta","author_email":"support@inbenta.com","author_url":null,"remote_installation_url":null,"short_description":"Search based on meaning - not keywords - within your Zendesk Knowledge Base","long_description":"<p>With Inbenta&#39;s Natural Language Search for Zendesk, your customers will get accurate and immediate answers to their questions based on the intention behind their query, not the keywords. <\/p>\n\n<p>Inbenta is a scalable, linguistic, and semantic-based search engine for the enterprise client. <\/p>\n\n<p>Inbenta&#39;s Natural Language Search Engine brings you: <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost Benefit<\/strong>: based on a unique technology that combines lexical and linguistic search algorithms, our search engine understands the intention of every search query and suggests results that are relevant, thus increasing cross-selling and reducing customer service costs. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Customer Insight<\/strong>: thanks to our exclusive Semantic Clustering technology, you&#39;ll have in-depth insight into the actual needs of your customers based on their searches. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Robustness<\/strong>: our core technology is deployed on most enterprise architectures, ensuring service quality and scalability. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Integration<\/strong>: Inbenta&#39;s engine is designed to be integrated quickly into existing intranets and websites.

The platform also supports connectors to many 3rd party applications, platforms, databases, and web services enabling data to be easily shared between these systems and your inContact telephony environment. \r\n\r\n[Click here for a video demo of the integration](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fa7tRSqdick)","installation_instructions":"<p>A CDC Platform implementation, due to the complex nature of most enterprise customer&#39;s telephony environments, requires an initial discovery session with the customer to gather information about the customer&#39;s existing telephony system.

This is included for security reasons so only users who exist in the domain can back up the content.\r\n* The app will work for any Zendesk Help Center, even if you chose to use the Host Mapping feature as the original Zendesk sub-domain will still exist, regardless of what you have currently set as your hostname.\r\n* Using the app to back up your Help Center content is completely safe and will not affect any existing data, it will simply take a copy of it so there is no possibility for data loss during the process.\r\n\r\n","installation_instructions":"<h3>Getting started<\/h3>\n\n<p>To get started with kBackup head on over to our documentation below on how to do your very first backup: <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/community\/posts\/210927837\">https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/community\/posts\/210927837<\/a> <\/p>\n","raw_installation_instructions":"### Getting started\r\n\r\nTo get started with kBackup head on over to our documentation below on how to do your very first backup: [https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/community\/posts\/210927837](https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/community\/posts\/210927837) \r\n","small_icon":"https:\/\/94262.apps.zdusercontent.com\/94262\/assets\/1470075006-185eb909d91bc4f5c21f8a8c62280084\/logo-small.png","large_icon":"https:\/\/94262.apps.zdusercontent.com\/94262\/assets\/1470075069-4089807f5be3175bd038dacf795ff91a\/logo.png","screenshots":["https:\/\/94262.apps.zdusercontent.com\/94262\/assets\/1470075094-0acacdd5ca2ea4fee7125ae765519cf3\/screenshot-0.png","https:\/\/94262.apps.zdusercontent.com\/94262\/assets\/1470075104-1f6f551618c0d01f81471e9b46f208b7\/screenshot-1.png","https:\/\/94262.apps.zdusercontent.com\/94262\/assets\/1470075117-e2751a52be8e4eaba087e0f17939357b\/screenshot-2.png"],"visibility":"public","installable":false,"created_at":"2016-08-01T18:10:46Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T18:16:18Z","framework_version":"","featured":false,"promoted":false,"products":["support"],"categories":[{"id":24,"name":"Knowledge & Content"}],"version":null,"marketing_only":true,"deprecated":false,"obsolete":false,"paid":false,"rating":"stars-","feature_color":"#9e9e9e","google_analytics_code":null,"parameters":[],"plans":[],"name_clean":"kbackup","url":"\/apps\/kbackup\/","cats":"knowledge-content","num_ratings":0,"cost":"FREE","trigger":"Install","icon_url":"https:\/\/94262.apps.zdusercontent.com\/94262\/assets\/1470075069-4089807f5be3175bd038dacf795ff91a\/logo.png","created":1470075046},{"id":93649,"owner_id":269519,"name":"Keatext","single_install":false,"default_locale":"en","author_name":"Keatext","author_email":"support@keatext.ai ","author_url":null,"remote_installation_url":null,"short_description":"Customer feedback analytics and reporting app ","long_description":"<p>Keatext uses natural language processing and machine learning technology to analyze unstructured customer feedback such as case descriptions, customer comments, emails, chat logs, and more.<\/p>\n\n<p>Core features include the ability to import and export data, sentiment analysis, topic detection, data visualization and report collaboration and integration with other customer feedback applications.

Then when you surf over to Zendesk, you can see the full text of the conversation you just had, along with information about the visitor. On the sidebar you can even see we've created a profile for the visitor so you can easily access past conversations you've had with them.\r\n\r\n#### How to add Olark to your Help Center\r\n\r\n1. Log into your newly enabled Help Center and click on the \"Customize Design\" in the tool bar in the lower right. \r\n![Step 1](http:\/\/cl.ly\/image\/130O3k292x14\/skitch.png) \r\n2. Under \"Theme\", click on the \"Edit HTML\" link to bring up the code editor. \r\n![Step 2](http:\/\/cl.ly\/image\/0A0Q2I1i1y2M\/skitch2.png) \r\n3. In the theme page, select the \"Footer\" template from the available HTML templates. This will allow for you to edit the direct code for the footer on every page. \r\n![Step 3](http:\/\/cl.ly\/image\/1d2f0D0p2t1M\/skitch3.png) \r\n4. After the closing tag, add in your custom Javascript provided by Olark. You can click on the \"Preview\" button to see the change in a draft mode of your Help Center page. Click on the green \"\"Save\"\" button to save you edits. \r\n![Step 4](http:\/\/cl.ly\/image\/2L233J2D2I3l\/skitch4.png) \r\n5. After you click the \"Save\" button, you will be taken back to the editor. Click on the green \"Publish changes\" button to finalize the change and publish to all visitors of your new Help Center!\"","small_icon":"\/api\/v2\/apps\/1446\/assets\/logo-small.png","large_icon":"\/api\/v2\/apps\/1446\/assets\/logo.png","screenshots":["\/api\/v2\/apps\/1446\/assets\/screenshot-0.png","\/api\/v2\/apps\/1446\/assets\/screenshot-1.png","\/api\/v2\/apps\/1446\/assets\/screenshot-2.png"],"visibility":"public","installable":false,"created_at":"2012-09-10T23:22:45Z","updated_at":"2015-02-06T17:11:47Z","framework_version":"","featured":false,"promoted":false,"products":["support"],"categories":[{"id":39,"name":"Chat & Collaboration"}],"version":null,"marketing_only":true,"deprecated":false,"obsolete":false,"paid":false,"rating":"stars-","feature_color":"#9e9e9e","google_analytics_code":null,"parameters":[],"plans":[],"name_clean":"olark-live-chat","url":"\/apps\/olark-live-chat\/","cats":"chat-collaboration","num_ratings":0,"cost":"FREE","trigger":"Install","icon_url":"https:\/\/d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net\/images\/p-apps-marketplace\/apps\/1446\/logo.png","created":1347319365},{"id":58306,"owner_id":1,"name":"OnBoardify","single_install":false,"default_locale":"en","author_name":"OnBoardify","author_email":"hello@onboardify.com","author_url":null,"remote_installation_url":null,"short_description":"OnBoardify is the #1 onboarding automation platform for web and mobile apps.","long_description":"<h1>OnBoardify for Zendesk<\/h1>\n\n<h2>Your instant connection to customers when they are using your application<\/h2>\n\n<p>OnBoardify is the <em>#1 onboarding automation platform<\/em> for online businesses.

It\u2019s an all-around time saver for everyone involved. \r\n\r\nNow serving over 20,000 businesses, OnSIP is a real-time communications service with better features, flexibility, and cost than traditional phone systems.\r\n\r\nTo learn more and see a demo video, visit [http:\/\/www.onsip.com\/tools\/zendesk](http:\/\/www.onsip.com\/tools\/zendesk)","installation_instructions":"<p>Download the new Google Chrome extension <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/onsip-call-assistant\/pceelmncccldedfkcgjkpemakjbapnpg\">here<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n<p>Check out how to set up the Chrome extension <a href=\"http:\/\/www.junctionnetworks.com\/knowledgebase\/onsip\/integrations\/onsip-call-assistant-for-google-chrome\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","raw_installation_instructions":"Download the new Google Chrome extension [here](https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/onsip-call-assistant\/pceelmncccldedfkcgjkpemakjbapnpg)!\r\n\r\nCheck out how to set up the Chrome extension [here](http:\/\/www.junctionnetworks.com\/knowledgebase\/onsip\/integrations\/onsip-call-assistant-for-google-chrome).","small_icon":"\/api\/v2\/apps\/1931\/assets\/logo-small.png","large_icon":"\/api\/v2\/apps\/1931\/assets\/logo.png","screenshots":["\/api\/v2\/apps\/1931\/assets\/screenshot-0.png","\/api\/v2\/apps\/1931\/assets\/screenshot-1.png","\/api\/v2\/apps\/1931\/assets\/screenshot-2.png"],"visibility":"public","installable":false,"created_at":"2012-10-04T00:21:33Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T20:38:06Z","framework_version":"","featured":false,"promoted":false,"products":["support"],"categories":[{"id":30,"name":"Telephony & SMS"}],"version":null,"marketing_only":true,"deprecated":false,"obsolete":false,"paid":false,"rating":"stars-","feature_color":"#9e9e9e","google_analytics_code":null,"parameters":[],"plans":[],"name_clean":"onsip","url":"\/apps\/onsip\/","cats":"telephony-sms","num_ratings":0,"cost":"FREE","trigger":"Install","icon_url":"https:\/\/d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net\/images\/p-apps-marketplace\/apps\/1931\/logo.png","created":1349310093},{"id":61978,"owner_id":1,"name":"OOPS","single_install":false,"default_locale":"en","author_name":"Zendesk Labs","author_email":"zendesklabs@zendesk.com","author_url":"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com","remote_installation_url":null,"short_description":"Cancel a ticket submission!","long_description":"<p>Once an agent has submitted a ticket, a small popup notification appears that allows the agent the option to cancel the submission within a configurable timeout or default timeout of 10 seconds.<\/p>\n","raw_long_description":"Once an agent has submitted a ticket, a small popup notification appears that allows the agent the option to cancel the submission within a configurable timeout or default timeout of 10 seconds.","installation_instructions":"<p>When you install the app, the option &#39;Allow each agent to select his own timeout to cancel a ticket submission&#39; is unchecked by default, this will set the default timeout of 10 seconds for every agent and the app will be running in the background.

For example, to display the current user's ID in your text, add `{{current_user.id}}` in the Text app, and it will display as the current user's ID (`2313`, for example).\r\n\r\nAlso, you could put this into a URL as a parameter:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \/\/ This is the text I would put in the settings:\r\n    https:\/\/www.example.com?user={{current_user.id}}\r\n\r\n    \/\/ and this is how Text app would render it:\r\n    https:\/\/www.example.com?user=2313\r\n\r\nAlthough it's not obvious in this example, Text app will auto link URLs for you.\r\n\r\n#### Data placeholders you can use\r\n\r\nEach of the data placeholders below render a string:\r\n\r\n* `ticket.id` current ticket ID\r\n* `ticket.subject` current ticket subject\r\n* `ticket.status` current ticket status\r\n* `ticket.priority` current ticket priority\r\n* `ticket.type` current ticket type\r\n* `ticket.tags` current ticket tags, comma separated\r\n* `ticket.requester.id` current ticket requester's ID\r\n* `ticket.requester.name` current ticket requester's name\r\n* `ticket.requester.email` current ticket requester's email\r\n* `ticket.assignee.id` current ticket assignee's ID\r\n* `ticket.assignee.name` current ticket assignee's name\r\n* `ticket.assignee.email` current ticket assignee's email\r\n* `current_user.id` currently logged in user's ID\r\n* `current_user.name` currently logged in user's name\r\n* `current_user.email` currently logged in user's email\r\n\r\nMore data placeholders will be added in the future.","small_icon":"https:\/\/1691.apps.zdusercontent.com\/1691\/assets\/1477544113-d1bb66c551d776d934b8701c6fe229d0\/logo-small.png","large_icon":"https:\/\/1691.apps.zdusercontent.com\/1691\/assets\/1477544113-d1bb66c551d776d934b8701c6fe229d0\/logo.png","screenshots":["https:\/\/1691.apps.zdusercontent.com\/1691\/assets\/1477544113-d1bb66c551d776d934b8701c6fe229d0\/screenshot-0.png","https:\/\/1691.apps.zdusercontent.com\/1691\/assets\/1477544113-d1bb66c551d776d934b8701c6fe229d0\/screenshot-1.png"],"visibility":"public","installable":true,"created_at":"2012-09-18T23:15:02Z","updated_at":"2016-12-09T22:26:38Z","framework_version":"1.0","featured":false,"promoted":false,"products":["support"],"categories":[{"id":43,"name":"Productivity & Time-tracking"}],"version":"1.0.2","marketing_only":false,"deprecated":false,"obsolete":false,"paid":false,"rating":"stars-3","feature_color":"#9e9e9e","google_analytics_code":null,"parameters":[{"id":2191,"app_id":1691,"name":"name","kind":"text","required":true,"position":0,"created_at":"2012-09-18T23:15:02Z","updated_at":"2012-09-18T23:15:02Z","default_value":null,"secure":false},{"id":2190,"app_id":1691,"name":"textBody","kind":"multiline","required":true,"position":1,"created_at":"2012-09-18T23:15:02Z","updated_at":"2012-09-18T23:15:02Z","default_value":null,"secure":false},{"id":4752,"app_id":1691,"name":"openLinksInTabs","kind":"checkbox","required":false,"position":2,"created_at":"2012-11-08T20:43:05Z","updated_at":"2012-11-08T20:43:05Z","default_value":null,"secure":false}],"plans":[],"name_clean":"text","url":"\/apps\/text\/","cats":"productivity-time-tracking","num_ratings":609,"cost":"FREE","trigger":"Install","icon_url":"https:\/\/1691.apps.zdusercontent.com\/1691\/assets\/1477544113-d1bb66c551d776d934b8701c6fe229d0\/logo.png","created":1348010102},{"id":89497,"owner_id":269519,"name":"Textline","single_install":false,"default_locale":"en","author_name":"Mark Lilien","author_email":"extapi@textline.com","author_url":"http:\/\/textline.com","remote_installation_url":null,"short_description":"Textline lets customer support teams receive SMS messages from users","long_description":"<p>Textline is a text messaging platform for your customer support team.

To create a new ticket, click on the \u201cNew Ticket\u201d button.\r\n2. New ticket form will be automatically filled with the chat transcript.\r\nFill it with a description and optionally assign the new ticket to a group\/agent. Then click on create.\r\n3. After the transfer, the new ticket will be available in Zendesk.\r\n\r\n\r\n","small_icon":"\/api\/v2\/apps\/5915\/assets\/logo-small.png","large_icon":"\/api\/v2\/apps\/5915\/assets\/logo.png","screenshots":["\/api\/v2\/apps\/5915\/assets\/screenshot-0.png","\/api\/v2\/apps\/5915\/assets\/screenshot-1.png","\/api\/v2\/apps\/5915\/assets\/screenshot-2.png"],"visibility":"public","installable":false,"created_at":"2013-01-29T17:33:13Z","updated_at":"2015-01-05T19:00:17Z","framework_version":"","featured":false,"promoted":false,"products":["support"],"categories":[{"id":39,"name":"Chat & Collaboration"}],"version":null,"marketing_only":true,"deprecated":false,"obsolete":false,"paid":false,"rating":"stars-","feature_color":"#9e9e9e","google_analytics_code":null,"parameters":[],"plans":[],"name_clean":"vivocha","url":"\/apps\/vivocha\/","cats":"chat-collaboration","num_ratings":0,"cost":"FREE","trigger":"Install","icon_url":"https:\/\/d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net\/images\/p-apps-marketplace\/apps\/5915\/logo.png","created":1359480793},{"id":72036,"owner_id":1,"name":"Volusion by Cloud Elements","single_install":false,"default_locale":"en","author_name":"Cloud Elements","author_email":"support@cloud-elements.com","author_url":"http:\/\/www.cloud-elements.com","remote_installation_url":null,"short_description":"Help minimize time wasted searching for customers","long_description":"<h3>Overview<\/h3>\n\n<p>The Zendesk Volusion App by Cloud Elements allows customer service representatives instant access to your Customers&#39; current account status in Volusion.
