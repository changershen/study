<h1>Protect your IT Assets: Enhancing Patch and Asset Management with Integrated Ticket Management</h1>
</a>
</header>
 
<div class="resource-body">
<div class="resource-body-content animate-slideup ungated">

<p>The consequences of overlooking even a single security vulnerability can be severe. If a computer on the enterprise network gets infected with malware, it can be expensive to fix, and may also prevent users from being productive while the problem is being addressed. Staying on top of security vulnerabilities and compliance requirements in today?s complex IT environments requires monitoring and management tools that can automate IT Service Management (ITSM) processes and increase visibility.</p>
<p>Traditionally, enterprise ITSM tools have been one of the most common ways to provide such monitoring and management capabilities. However, the cost of these enterprise management solutions is high both in terms of software licenses and the extra cost of specialized administrators and training needed to take full advantage of the tools. Some businesses have chosen to avoid these high costs by instead using point solutions for their most important ITSM needs and augmenting the tools with manual tracking and reporting methods. While this is a cost-effective way to enable some ITSM capabilities such as patch and asset management, it also puts a greater burden on IT support teams because of the manual steps involved.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the era of cloud computing has enabled a new approach to ITSM wherein best-of-breed tools can be used together at a fraction of the cost of traditional enterprise management frameworks. The cloud makes it easy to use multiple tools and to integrate them together, giving IT organizations the choice to deploy an industry-leading support solution along with other cloud-based ITSM tools such as patch and asset management. This avoids the high cost and increased complexity of an all-in-one ITSM tool, which would likely include capabilities that would never be used.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on how a cloud-based help desk solution can be deployed with a cloud-based patch and asset management tool to achieve the following business benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduced exposure to risk ? Proactive management of assets and an automated patch update process to help reduce the risk that security vulnerabilities will go unnoticed.</li>
<li>Greater efficiency ? The integrated approach saves time and resources through automated releases of patch updates. This is also accomplished with efficient communication to IT support teams through detailed hardware and software status information that can be encapsulated within <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/help-desk-software/additional-features/ticketing-system/">help desk tickets</a>.</li>
<li>Expedited issue resolution ? The help desk capability expedites resolution of security vulnerabilities that are identified via the patch and asset management tool. A help desk ticket can be automatically assigned, enabling a controlled measurable workflow and visibility of progress toward resolution.</li>
<li>Greater management control ? Managers can have real-time visibility into the types of vulnerabilities being exposed as well as the speed with which they are resolved. Audit and compliance requirements are also simplified through flexible reporting on status of assets, software licenses, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To manage IT assets and properly understand security risks, IT support teams need to have easy access to the latest configuration and status information for all of the organization?s desktops, servers, and laptops. In some cases, there are thousands of systems to monitor, making manual methods of tracking this information too inefficient to be practical.</p>
<p>IT support teams also need to work efficiently, and that requires real-time visibility into the following types of information for every system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Location and ownership or responsible party for all hardware components</li>
<li>Software components installed</li>
<li>Status of software licenses and maintenance contracts</li>
<li>Currently installed patch levels for the operating system and key software components</li>
<li>Latest security and update patches that have been made available from OS and application software vendors but not yet installed</li>
</ol>
<p>These capabilities can be provided by a cloud-based patch and asset management environment, but in most cases, this is not enough. The patch and asset management solution can identify vulnerabilities, but provides minimal oversight for their resolution. When patch and asset management is integrated with help desk capabilities, tickets are automatically created as soon as an issue is identified, enabling issues to be tracked with the kind of visibility and control that assures proper resolution.</p>
<h2>Why Integrate Help Desk with Patch and Aset Management?</h2>
<p>Unlike complex enterprise management tools that include many capabilities that IT support teams won?t use, the focused approach of integrating a cloud-based patch and asset management tool with a cloud-based help desk tool provides the visibility and control needed to stay on top of security vulnerabilities without the high cost for software licenses or the extensive training that is often associated with enterprise management solutions. Furthermore, a cloud-based approach means that organizations can pay for it from their operating expense budget rather than creating a justification for a capital expenditure. And finally, cloud-based ITSM solutions can be scaled quickly and cost-effectively as the IT infrastructure grows.</p>
<p><strong>Integrating a best-of-breed patch and asset management tool with your help desk solution enables a focused and comprehensive approach</strong>, giving IT support teams the ability to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manage and track devices, including whether the device is remotely accessing applications and data</li>
<li>Track patching on Microsoft Windows and applications, as well as third party software</li>
<li>Monitor a single view of status information that presents help desk ticket information and device status details in the same dashboard</li>
<li>Work remotely from mobile devices because the cloud-based dashboard offers access from any mobile device or desktop</li>
</ol>
<p>Managers can also use the help desk reporting capabilities to watch trends over time or to monitor for improvements after making process changes. For example, it may be useful to monitor trends in metrics such as the average number of outstanding issues, time to resolution, and number of high severity issues. Patch and asset management tools don?t generally provide visibility into aggregated data for monitoring trends, but help desk tools are designed to enable management oversight.</p>
<h2>Reducing Risk of Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>To keep security vulnerabilities under control and reduce risk, organizations need two different kinds of IT management capabilities. IT support teams need the right tools to identify security vulnerabilities, and a help desk workflow is needed to track and manage each issue so that vulnerabilities get fully resolved in a timely manner.</p>
<p>A best-of-breed tool for patch and asset management can simplify the process of identifying vulnerabilities because the tool is designed just for that purpose. For example, an automated scan can be run at regular intervals and set up to identify the following types of vulnerabilities and bring them to the attention of the IT support team via the help desk:</p>
<ol>
<li>Outdated software licenses</li>
<li>Systems that have missed patch updates</li>
<li>Software applications that have not been updated to the desired version</li>
<li>Overdue anti-virus scans</li>
<li>Systems without proper firewall protection or password/screensaver protection</li>
</ol>
<p>For maximum efficiency, it?s best if this kind of information can be presented graphically as illustrated in Figure 1. This allows IT support teams to quickly identify the most urgent issues and also easily find the equipment that needs attention.</p>
<p><img class="clear" style="padding: 0px;" alt="Patch and Asset Management" src="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/images/p-resources/whitepaper-protectingitassets-1.png"/></p>
<p>To illustrate how the combination of patch and asset management with help desk workflows can reduce risk, consider the following example. Suppose that a particular user?s system was powered off during a recent software update or was disconnected from the network and missed a patch update. When that system comes back online, the next patch and asset management scan would discover the problem and automatically notify an IT support team member.</p>
<p>Identifying the issue is a critical first step. However, ensuring timely and proper resolution requires that the security vulnerability be tracked within a help desk work-low. The automatic help desk ticketing system makes it easy for such vulnerabilities to be documented and provides a consistent process for managing their resolution.</p>
<p>As soon as a new vulnerability is detected, the ticket would be automatically logged for the IT support team to see within the help desk environment. In many cases, this happens before the user even knows something is wrong. Leveraging help desk workflows to manage issue resolution can help reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Providing greater visibility to IT executives and support teams regarding vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Making it easier for support teams to prioritize work according to the most critical business needs</li>
<li>Enabling automated actions that speed the response to vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Enforcing a consistent escalation process to help reduce average resolution time</li>
<li>Simplifying compliance and audit requirements by providing visibility into ticket history, conversations, and more.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, whenever a user notices that a system is behaving abnormally, or simply doesn?t work, a ticket can be generated by the user. Even though the user may not understand the issue, data can be automatically collected from the user?s system and forwarded with the ticket to help IT support teams pinpoint the exact problem.</p>
<p>Another example of how a combined solution helps reduce risk is by making it easier to manage software licenses, providing visibility and control over the use of unlicensed, unapproved, or unsupported software on user systems. If a user installs an unapproved software component on their desktop system, the new software component would automatically be detected by the patch and asset management tool and a warning would be immediately issued inside the help desk solution. This would result in a ticket that prompts the IT support team to act upon the issue quickly so that the vulnerability is short-lived.</p>
<h2>Improving the Efficiency of IT Support Teams</h2>
<p>In addition to reducing the risk of vulnerabilities, an integrated solution also helps IT support teams work more efficiently, thus reducing support costs. The proactive scanning of all assets within the organization enables IT support teams to cost-effectively monitor the environment with very little manual effort.</p>
<p>Detailed data about the incident can be automatically collected through agents installed on the user?s system, providing context and technical details that can be very useful to IT support teams. Crucial information such as the platform OS and version, user?s installed software applications, hardware information, and even a link to remote access control can give IT support teams a head start because they have immediate access to all the information they need as soon as they open the help desk ticket. In addition, the patch and asset management system can continue to collect more information after a ticket is logged. Thus if the status of a system changes after a ticket is created, the help desk environment can be automatically updated so that IT support teams can view the latest information right when a help desk ticket is opened.</p>
<p>Automated collection of device status information is especially helpful for user-initiated tickets. When users call a help desk hotline, they often lack a basic understanding of IT terminology and may have difficulty explaining the issue to IT. In many cases, the user may not even know what operating system or application versions they are running. An integrated help desk solution enables this information to be captured from the user?s system and can thus make communication easier for both users and IT support teams.</p>
<h2>Expediting Issue Resolution</h2>
<p>Once a help desk ticket is created, whether automatically or by a user, the ticket can be managed through a configurable automated workflow that helps speed up resolution and minimize risk. Using a help desk ticket aids and expedites resolution by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying an owner for each issue</li>
<li>Providing automatic escalation for issues that do not get addressed</li>
<li>Improving management visibility into how well IT teams are doing at resolving issues</li>
</ol>
<p>The help desk workflow makes it clear who is assigned to handle each issue and provides greater visibility for tracking progress on outstanding issues. If a help desk agent does not get to a ticket in time, the system can automatically perform an action to resolve the ticket or escalate the process.</p>
<h2>Integration in Action</h2>
<p>The capabilities described in this paper are not just a theoretical vision about the future. A cost-effective cloud-based integrated solution is available today from Zendesk and Panorama9. In fact, it is in use today at Ledarna, the Swedish Organization for Managers.</p>
<p>When Ledarna began to outgrow their homegrown internal IT support platform in 2009, they wanted to implement a cloud-based solution that would combine customer support with a patch management capability. Having had a positive experience using Zendesk for customer support, they took a look at Zendesk?s 100+ integrations and found Panorama9.</p>
<p>Here?s what Ledarna has been able to achieve using Zendesk and Panorama9 together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Average customer satisfaction rating: 98%</li>
<li>Average first response time: 41 minutes</li>
<li>50% of solved tickets are resolved in less than 24 hours.</li>
<li>Transformed support from ad-hoc scribbles on pieces of paper to a controlled, measurable workflow in Zendesk and Panorama9.</li>
<li>Measure and report on ticket management to place a ?price tag? on support services.</li>
</ol>
<p>The combined solution from Zendesk and Panorama9 includes an integrated dashboard where the latest information about help desk tickets is available along with status information for the IT assets. Thus there is no need for IT support engineers to flip back and forth between dashboards for accessing the information needed to resolve issues.</p>
<p><i>We are seeing enormous productivity benefits. We are getting more tickets from our users because it's more accessible for them to make requests. But we can solve tickets easier and faster because we have greater visibility on our users and infrastructure.</i> -Alex Tsarapatsanis, IT Technician, Ledarna</p>
<h2>How the Integration Works with Zendesk and Panorama9</h2>
<p>The Zendesk integration with Panorama9 is accomplished by using the notification feature in Panorama9 to automatically create a Zendesk ticket. For more information about the integration and how to set it up, please refer to the Zendesk getting started guide at <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/entries/21504966-panorama9-it-monitoring-asset-management-and-more" target="_blank">https://support.zendesk.com/entries/21504966-panorama9-it-monitoring-asset-management-and-more</a>.</p>

<p>An internal IT department is an interesting place to work. You feel buffered from the front-lines of 'real' customer support, yet the systems you monitor and maintain often directly affect the experience of those external paying customers in some way. So, by giving the best support possible internally, you're helping to ensure great service and support to the end-customer, too.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, customers are the people who are paying for the product or service they're getting. For an internal IT team, those are the people who pay your salary and for the tools you use in your role. They're the decision-makers â€” the same people who agree on the service levels between IT and the rest of the organization. Users, on the other hand, are those people who use your IT services in the office every day, contacting you with issues that may be hindering their ability to do their jobs.</p>
<p>A great IT manager knows how to balance the needs of the paying customer against the needs of the users. They have to ensure network usability, meet the service level targets set by business units and roll out new projects, all without blowing the budget on staff and assets.</p>
<p>A great IT professional not only enjoys the puzzle of solving a problem; they care about their rep, too. And a great rep comes from good support interactions. When it comes to IT support, it stands to reason that the technical difference between the customer and the user matters little. They both deserve responsiveness and helpfulness.</p>
<p>At Zendesk, we believe your users are customers, too. It's true they're not paying for the service you're giving them, but their experience with your IT support team has a direct impact on your reputation â€” just like 'real' customers do. Zendesk gives you a fast and simple way of providing customer-centric IT support, but with all the power and flexibility of customized workflows and reporting. We've simplified traditional IT service management processes so you can focus on being the most personable and productive IT department, ever. And over the coming weeks, I'll be sharing some tips on how you can go about it.</p>

<h1>Five trends impacting the enterprise IT help desk</h1>
</a>
</header>
 
<div class="resource-body">
<div class="resource-body-content animate-slideup ungated">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Todays enterprise IT support organizations and help desks are experiencing a dramatic shift in the way technologies are developed, deployed and consumed. Applications are evolving faster than ever, with new cloud-based solutions emerging almost weekly to replace the stodgy on-premise solutions of generations past. User expectations arent far behind; a new generation of tech-savvy users increasingly expects the latest and greatest, including mobile compatibility. The result is a constantly evolving portfolio of applications and technologies that IT organizations must support, while being more responsive and empathetic than ever beforeall without increasing costs.</p>
<p>As always, progress is a double-edged sword for IT support. Because IT is responsible for enabling company-wide productivity, it sits squarely under the collective corporate microscope. User satisfaction is now at the forefront as new technologies enable more efficient communication, which is both boon and bane to IT support. Seeking comments and anticipating issues are the keys to effective support, and new technologies are also simplifying the feedback process.</p>
<p>This paper presents five interrelated trends impacting the way IT support organizations operate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Productivity pressures</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong><strong>Cloud computing</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong><strong>Consumerization of IT</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong><strong>Corporate social media</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong><strong>Raising the bar on service</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The intended audience for this paper includes executives, IT management, software development/QA leadership, and anyone else interested in delivering unsurpassed support.</p>
<h2>1. Productivity Pressures</h2>
<p>Perhaps no single organization is as vital to company-wide productivity as IT. While most organizations are responsible for their own efficiency, IT ultimately owns that of the entire enterprise. Driving efficiency across an entire organization comes down to two key areas: tools and procedures. IT must effectively select and employ both to keep everyone happy and productive.</p>
<h3><strong>Choosing the right software</strong></h3>
<p>Ideal applications combine usability and consistency with brisk implementation and low maintenance. The former, usability and consistency, are vital to managing the IT help desk's workload. Ensuring that users are quickly able to understand the interface and that it works consistently will minimize the number of end-user issues. By keeping implementation times short and maintenance low, IT technicians have more time to focus on resolving existing issues and implementing new productivity-enhancing systems.</p>
<h3><strong>Stringent vs. fluid procedures</strong></h3>
<p>Many IT support organizations looking to increase efficiency are turning to best practice frameworks, such as ITIL, that provide guidance on how IT should deploy and support software. However, there's a significant risk of getting bogged down in endless processes, paperwork, and heavyweight technology deployments aimed at optimizing the support experience. <b>The IT help desk must balance the desire to comply with rigid standards and best practices with the reality of needing to provide excellent service to their customers (end users) right now.</b> Ultimately, successful organizations will use ITIL and related methodologies as a blueprint and let procedures evolve as feedback dictates.</p>
<h3><strong>The right support platform</strong></h3>
<p>The last piece of the IT help desk puzzle is using a support platform that makes life easier for agents and end users alike. For end users, this means a simple interface for submitting issues and knowledge bases where users can quickly locate answers or discuss issues with the community. For agents, this means a system that increases end-user visibility into ticket status, is able to automate repetitive tasks and helps process feedback. Finding the right blend is vital, since all customer interactions are routed through the customer support platform. (More on this in trend five: Raising the Bar on Customer Service.)</p>
<h2>2. Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>The C-suite mantra for IT has always been faster, better, cheaper â€” doing more with less. Software as a service (SaaS or cloud-based software) is now delivering on this promise. Improvements in underlying infrastructure have solved the uptime and scaling issues that plagued SaaS solutions in the early 2000s, turning them into the go-to delivery method for customer relationship management (CRM), marketing automation and customer support. Cloud-based solutions have several benefits over on-premise solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple and inexpensive deployment</li>
<li>Access to data from anywhere, including mobile devices</li>
<li>No hardware or maintenance costs</li>
<li>Fewer data security issues</li>
<li>Seamless product updates</li>
<li>Affordable, pay-as-you go pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>Many large providers are now planning to migrate legacy on-premise solutions to the cloud knowing that IT departments are increasingly willing to outsource data security, upgrades and maintenance to software providers. As cloud becomes the industry standard, help desk staff must be ready to support a diverse set of applications that need less technical day-to-day involvement, but change more often and require them to support these changes.</p>
<p><b>When things go wrong, the IT help desk is the first line of support,</b> whether these resources<br/>
and applications reside in the cloud, behind the firewall, or a mixture of both. In fact, there's a good chance most users won't know (or care) who owns the resource: all they know is that they need help â€” right now, and they're unsympathetic to gaps between data that lives in the cloud and data that resides on-premise.</p>
<h2>3. Consumerization of IT</h2>
<p>Today's users are reaping the rewards of two rapidly evolving fields, mobile device manufacturing and consumer website development, which are increasing IT expectations in today's user base.</p>
<p>As mobile devices continue to expand their power, sophistication and reach, users are acclimating to streamlined native application experiences, intuitive interfaces and constant data availability. Further, phones are becoming the center of many peoples' online lives thanks to robust social apps like PathÂ® and FoursquareÂ®, leaving them unwilling to adopt separate work devices. These high expectations are creating a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) culture where support for multiple platforms is expected.</p>
<p>A recent CIO.com article showed that 60% of respondents are seeing increased support demand for AppleÂ®'s MacÂ® OS XÂ®10. This is partly due to the rising popularity of iOS through the iPhone and iPad, but also a sign that Macs are gaining market share at home where employees are skewing the traditional work/life balance. At home, consumer websites, such as FacebookÂ® and TwitterÂ®, are gaining mobile-like elegance and interactivity thanks to advancements in front-end languages, and many of these popular consumer sites also have accompanying mobile apps that allow on-the-go access, which many now desire from their work applications. Even the most progressive IT departments are struggling to adapt responsibly.</p>
<p>These expectations are helping fuel cloud popularity thanks to browser-delivered flexibility. Many cloud apps support multiple operating systems and mobile devices, whereas on-premise solutions have limited compatibility. Cloud applications also benefit from the same front-end programming developments as consumer applications, meaning they have better interfaces that are more easily updated than their on-premise counterparts. Further, some cloud solutions have companion mobile apps that provide secure access to the native experience users crave. From a support perspective, <b>native apps help IT cope with today's BYOD climate by offloading compatibility and data security to providers.</b></p>
<h2>4. Corporate Social Media</h2>
<p>For many employees, social-networking platforms (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) are at the heart of their personal online experiences. Given their reliance on these tools, companies are turning to analogous corporate social media tools, such as YammerÂ®, to help fuel collaboration across divisions.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, employees are using these channels to seek assistance and/or vent about IT-related issues, making it an important channel for harnessing feedback and even deflecting issues. The help desk should monitor these channels for relevant conversations and interject when necessary by pointing users to relevant knowledge base articles or asking them to submit tickets for further help. By participating in the conversation, support looks proactive and can raise awareness about self-service resources â€” the latter of which may help deflect issues that would otherwise result in issues.</p>
<p>Further, corporate social media enables faster feedback and collaboration through polls and groups. What once took weeks of coordination can now be accomplished in a matter of hours by polling users or setting up a small task force to discuss an issue. In short, corporate social media can fuel productivity for IT departments the same way it does across the rest of the organization.</p>
<h2>5. Raising the Bar on Service</h2>
<p>IT is and always will be a service organization that's goal is to create a safe, productive environment for employees. For too long, IT organizations have focused on technology rather than users, but the tide is turning. Today's IT organizations are being encouraged to adopt a customer service view of IT support where customer satisfaction is the new measuring stick.</p>
<p>This is partly driven by IT's desire for continual process improvement, and partly driven by more demanding users. In an effort to align operations with the business and provide better service to this customer base, many IT teams are actively implementing industry standard best practices, including IT service management (ITSM) process-improvement methodologies.</p>
<p>Regardless of the exact name, these IT best practices recommend visualizing the interaction experience from the perspective of the customer (i.e. the user). This treats the delivery of all IT benefits as services, which is very different than traditional technology-centric viewpoints of IT and its offerings.</p>
<p>User requirements for the speed and quality of IT support are now much higher than ever before. IT organizations must adjust their focus towards their primary mission: delivering speedy, high-quality services that will be consumed by people, rather than spending excessive time tending to the underlying support technology that helps deliver these services. To ensure that they're on the right track and delivering the best possible service, it's essential for the IT team to continually seek feedback from their customers using surveys and other quantitative methods.</p>
<h3><b>Self-service</b></h3>
<p>Support organizations are learning that it's no longer possible to dictate how users will receive service. Self-service has become an increasingly common part of daily life, and users expect resources that help them answer their own questions. Providing online communities, FAQs and knowledge bases are simple ways to provide the 24-hour support users crave, and many customer support solutions include this functionality.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Coping with today's rapidly changing IT environment requires an agile team that's willing to adopt new technologies and take measured risks to better serve their internal customers. Cloud-based software is one of the best ways to cope with increased productivity pressures and device compatibility issues, making it a must on every CIO's list for future upgrades. As the cloud lessens maintenance concerns, support organizations must be ready to stay vigilant and improve documentation in order to better serve users at scale, while simultaneously harnessing feedback to adapt and improve processes and foresee issues. Lastly, progressive IT organizations will need to balance adherence to strict procedures with the need to keep internal customers happy.</p>
