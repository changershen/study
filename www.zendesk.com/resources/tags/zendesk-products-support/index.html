<p>Views in Zendesk are a great way to ensure that no ticket goes unanswered. Much as the name implies, views offer a particular way to look at your tickets throughout all stages of the ticket life cycle. Applied as a filter, views allow you to organize tickets in a meaningful way, within the context of your business needs.</p>
<p>Watch this 30-minute recorded webinar, where we take a deep dive into managing views in Zendesk. We begin by taking a hands-on look at working with the Zendesk pre-defined, editable views, as well as creating your own. We cover common issues easily resolved with ticket views, as well as demonstrate the value of a view when you apply conditions and actions to them.</p>

<h1>Protect your IT Assets: Enhancing Patch and Asset Management with Integrated Ticket Management</h1>

<p>The consequences of overlooking even a single security vulnerability can be severe. If a computer on the enterprise network gets infected with malware, it can be expensive to fix, and may also prevent users from being productive while the problem is being addressed. Staying on top of security vulnerabilities and compliance requirements in today?s complex IT environments requires monitoring and management tools that can automate IT Service Management (ITSM) processes and increase visibility.</p>
<p>Traditionally, enterprise ITSM tools have been one of the most common ways to provide such monitoring and management capabilities. However, the cost of these enterprise management solutions is high both in terms of software licenses and the extra cost of specialized administrators and training needed to take full advantage of the tools. Some businesses have chosen to avoid these high costs by instead using point solutions for their most important ITSM needs and augmenting the tools with manual tracking and reporting methods. While this is a cost-effective way to enable some ITSM capabilities such as patch and asset management, it also puts a greater burden on IT support teams because of the manual steps involved.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the era of cloud computing has enabled a new approach to ITSM wherein best-of-breed tools can be used together at a fraction of the cost of traditional enterprise management frameworks. The cloud makes it easy to use multiple tools and to integrate them together, giving IT organizations the choice to deploy an industry-leading support solution along with other cloud-based ITSM tools such as patch and asset management. This avoids the high cost and increased complexity of an all-in-one ITSM tool, which would likely include capabilities that would never be used.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on how a cloud-based help desk solution can be deployed with a cloud-based patch and asset management tool to achieve the following business benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduced exposure to risk ? Proactive management of assets and an automated patch update process to help reduce the risk that security vulnerabilities will go unnoticed.</li>
<li>Greater efficiency ? The integrated approach saves time and resources through automated releases of patch updates. This is also accomplished with efficient communication to IT support teams through detailed hardware and software status information that can be encapsulated within <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/help-desk-software/additional-features/ticketing-system/">help desk tickets</a>.</li>
<li>Expedited issue resolution ? The help desk capability expedites resolution of security vulnerabilities that are identified via the patch and asset management tool. A help desk ticket can be automatically assigned, enabling a controlled measurable workflow and visibility of progress toward resolution.</li>
<li>Greater management control ? Managers can have real-time visibility into the types of vulnerabilities being exposed as well as the speed with which they are resolved. Audit and compliance requirements are also simplified through flexible reporting on status of assets, software licenses, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To manage IT assets and properly understand security risks, IT support teams need to have easy access to the latest configuration and status information for all of the organization?s desktops, servers, and laptops. In some cases, there are thousands of systems to monitor, making manual methods of tracking this information too inefficient to be practical.</p>
<p>IT support teams also need to work efficiently, and that requires real-time visibility into the following types of information for every system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Location and ownership or responsible party for all hardware components</li>
<li>Software components installed</li>
<li>Status of software licenses and maintenance contracts</li>
<li>Currently installed patch levels for the operating system and key software components</li>
<li>Latest security and update patches that have been made available from OS and application software vendors but not yet installed</li>
</ol>
<p>These capabilities can be provided by a cloud-based patch and asset management environment, but in most cases, this is not enough. The patch and asset management solution can identify vulnerabilities, but provides minimal oversight for their resolution. When patch and asset management is integrated with help desk capabilities, tickets are automatically created as soon as an issue is identified, enabling issues to be tracked with the kind of visibility and control that assures proper resolution.</p>
<h2>Why Integrate Help Desk with Patch and Aset Management?</h2>
<p>Unlike complex enterprise management tools that include many capabilities that IT support teams won?t use, the focused approach of integrating a cloud-based patch and asset management tool with a cloud-based help desk tool provides the visibility and control needed to stay on top of security vulnerabilities without the high cost for software licenses or the extensive training that is often associated with enterprise management solutions. Furthermore, a cloud-based approach means that organizations can pay for it from their operating expense budget rather than creating a justification for a capital expenditure. And finally, cloud-based ITSM solutions can be scaled quickly and cost-effectively as the IT infrastructure grows.</p>
<p><strong>Integrating a best-of-breed patch and asset management tool with your help desk solution enables a focused and comprehensive approach</strong>, giving IT support teams the ability to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manage and track devices, including whether the device is remotely accessing applications and data</li>
<li>Track patching on Microsoft Windows and applications, as well as third party software</li>
<li>Monitor a single view of status information that presents help desk ticket information and device status details in the same dashboard</li>
<li>Work remotely from mobile devices because the cloud-based dashboard offers access from any mobile device or desktop</li>
</ol>
<p>Managers can also use the help desk reporting capabilities to watch trends over time or to monitor for improvements after making process changes. For example, it may be useful to monitor trends in metrics such as the average number of outstanding issues, time to resolution, and number of high severity issues. Patch and asset management tools don?t generally provide visibility into aggregated data for monitoring trends, but help desk tools are designed to enable management oversight.</p>
<h2>Reducing Risk of Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>To keep security vulnerabilities under control and reduce risk, organizations need two different kinds of IT management capabilities. IT support teams need the right tools to identify security vulnerabilities, and a help desk workflow is needed to track and manage each issue so that vulnerabilities get fully resolved in a timely manner.</p>
<p>A best-of-breed tool for patch and asset management can simplify the process of identifying vulnerabilities because the tool is designed just for that purpose. For example, an automated scan can be run at regular intervals and set up to identify the following types of vulnerabilities and bring them to the attention of the IT support team via the help desk:</p>
<ol>
<li>Outdated software licenses</li>
<li>Systems that have missed patch updates</li>
<li>Software applications that have not been updated to the desired version</li>
<li>Overdue anti-virus scans</li>
<li>Systems without proper firewall protection or password/screensaver protection</li>
</ol>
<p>For maximum efficiency, it?s best if this kind of information can be presented graphically as illustrated in Figure 1. This allows IT support teams to quickly identify the most urgent issues and also easily find the equipment that needs attention.</p>
<p><img class="clear" style="padding: 0px;" alt="Patch and Asset Management" src="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/images/p-resources/whitepaper-protectingitassets-1.png"/></p>
<p>To illustrate how the combination of patch and asset management with help desk workflows can reduce risk, consider the following example. Suppose that a particular user?s system was powered off during a recent software update or was disconnected from the network and missed a patch update. When that system comes back online, the next patch and asset management scan would discover the problem and automatically notify an IT support team member.</p>
<p>Identifying the issue is a critical first step. However, ensuring timely and proper resolution requires that the security vulnerability be tracked within a help desk work-low. The automatic help desk ticketing system makes it easy for such vulnerabilities to be documented and provides a consistent process for managing their resolution.</p>
<p>As soon as a new vulnerability is detected, the ticket would be automatically logged for the IT support team to see within the help desk environment. In many cases, this happens before the user even knows something is wrong. Leveraging help desk workflows to manage issue resolution can help reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Providing greater visibility to IT executives and support teams regarding vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Making it easier for support teams to prioritize work according to the most critical business needs</li>
<li>Enabling automated actions that speed the response to vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Enforcing a consistent escalation process to help reduce average resolution time</li>
<li>Simplifying compliance and audit requirements by providing visibility into ticket history, conversations, and more.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, whenever a user notices that a system is behaving abnormally, or simply doesn?t work, a ticket can be generated by the user. Even though the user may not understand the issue, data can be automatically collected from the user?s system and forwarded with the ticket to help IT support teams pinpoint the exact problem.</p>
<p>Another example of how a combined solution helps reduce risk is by making it easier to manage software licenses, providing visibility and control over the use of unlicensed, unapproved, or unsupported software on user systems. If a user installs an unapproved software component on their desktop system, the new software component would automatically be detected by the patch and asset management tool and a warning would be immediately issued inside the help desk solution. This would result in a ticket that prompts the IT support team to act upon the issue quickly so that the vulnerability is short-lived.</p>
<h2>Improving the Efficiency of IT Support Teams</h2>
<p>In addition to reducing the risk of vulnerabilities, an integrated solution also helps IT support teams work more efficiently, thus reducing support costs. The proactive scanning of all assets within the organization enables IT support teams to cost-effectively monitor the environment with very little manual effort.</p>
<p>Detailed data about the incident can be automatically collected through agents installed on the user?s system, providing context and technical details that can be very useful to IT support teams. Crucial information such as the platform OS and version, user?s installed software applications, hardware information, and even a link to remote access control can give IT support teams a head start because they have immediate access to all the information they need as soon as they open the help desk ticket. In addition, the patch and asset management system can continue to collect more information after a ticket is logged. Thus if the status of a system changes after a ticket is created, the help desk environment can be automatically updated so that IT support teams can view the latest information right when a help desk ticket is opened.</p>
<p>Automated collection of device status information is especially helpful for user-initiated tickets. When users call a help desk hotline, they often lack a basic understanding of IT terminology and may have difficulty explaining the issue to IT. In many cases, the user may not even know what operating system or application versions they are running. An integrated help desk solution enables this information to be captured from the user?s system and can thus make communication easier for both users and IT support teams.</p>
<h2>Expediting Issue Resolution</h2>
<p>Once a help desk ticket is created, whether automatically or by a user, the ticket can be managed through a configurable automated workflow that helps speed up resolution and minimize risk. Using a help desk ticket aids and expedites resolution by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying an owner for each issue</li>
<li>Providing automatic escalation for issues that do not get addressed</li>
<li>Improving management visibility into how well IT teams are doing at resolving issues</li>
</ol>
<p>The help desk workflow makes it clear who is assigned to handle each issue and provides greater visibility for tracking progress on outstanding issues. If a help desk agent does not get to a ticket in time, the system can automatically perform an action to resolve the ticket or escalate the process.</p>
<h2>Integration in Action</h2>
<p>The capabilities described in this paper are not just a theoretical vision about the future. A cost-effective cloud-based integrated solution is available today from Zendesk and Panorama9. In fact, it is in use today at Ledarna, the Swedish Organization for Managers.</p>
<p>When Ledarna began to outgrow their homegrown internal IT support platform in 2009, they wanted to implement a cloud-based solution that would combine customer support with a patch management capability. Having had a positive experience using Zendesk for customer support, they took a look at Zendesk?s 100+ integrations and found Panorama9.</p>
<p>Here?s what Ledarna has been able to achieve using Zendesk and Panorama9 together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Average customer satisfaction rating: 98%</li>
<li>Average first response time: 41 minutes</li>
<li>50% of solved tickets are resolved in less than 24 hours.</li>
<li>Transformed support from ad-hoc scribbles on pieces of paper to a controlled, measurable workflow in Zendesk and Panorama9.</li>
<li>Measure and report on ticket management to place a ?price tag? on support services.</li>
</ol>
<p>The combined solution from Zendesk and Panorama9 includes an integrated dashboard where the latest information about help desk tickets is available along with status information for the IT assets. Thus there is no need for IT support engineers to flip back and forth between dashboards for accessing the information needed to resolve issues.</p>
<p><i>We are seeing enormous productivity benefits. We are getting more tickets from our users because it's more accessible for them to make requests. But we can solve tickets easier and faster because we have greater visibility on our users and infrastructure.</i> -Alex Tsarapatsanis, IT Technician, Ledarna</p>
<h2>How the Integration Works with Zendesk and Panorama9</h2>
<p>The Zendesk integration with Panorama9 is accomplished by using the notification feature in Panorama9 to automatically create a Zendesk ticket. For more information about the integration and how to set it up, please refer to the Zendesk getting started guide at <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/entries/21504966-panorama9-it-monitoring-asset-management-and-more" target="_blank">https://support.zendesk.com/entries/21504966-panorama9-it-monitoring-asset-management-and-more</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Technology advances with cloud computing have enabled a new approach to ITSM wherein best-of-breed point solutions can be integrated together with relative ease. The integrated cloud-based solution from Panorama9 and Zendesk provides greater efficiency in patch and asset management to reduce IT support costs while also reducing exposure to vulnerabilities.

<p>There was a time when an email inbox was enough to provide online customer service. You simply set up an email alias for support requests, checked it a few times throughout the day, and lived happily ever after. But soon your customer base grew, your organization expanded, and you introduced new products and services. That meant more support requests coming in every day, making your inbox bust at the seams, becoming increasingly troublesome to tackle. Once the backbone of your customer support department, email has now become a monster too big and complex to tame.</p>
<p>As companies and organizations grow, the problems with a shared customer support email inbox become even more significant. It is nearly impossible to track conversations. Emails can receive multiple answers from different support agents, often leading to more confusion than resolution. In addition, some emails may never get a response; when enough of those incidents pile up it can lead to serious customer satisfaction issues. And, searching through email for past support requests can be exceedingly time-consuming.</p>
<p>In this paper, we'll discuss how migrating from email to cloud-based customer service software such as Zendesk is the fastest and easiest way to boost the efficiency of your customer service department. We will examine how quickly you can shift away from your current customer support system and towards cloud-based customer service software, as well as how it can increase the speed, capabilities, and quality of your customer support department. And, we'll tell you what you can do in the next 24 hours to tame your inbox and gain new tools to support your customers.</p>
<h2>The Global Inbox</h2>
<p>Over time, email has become the new standard for communication between businesses and customers, as well as between internal support organizations such as an IT help desk and employees within a company.</p>
<p>Email is prolific and few people can complain that they get too little email every day. In fact, in 2013, 182.9 billion emails were sent per day, worldwide.</p>
<h2>Does Email Scale As Your Business Grows?</h2>
<p>Without question, email has revolutionized the customer support world. Businesses of all sizes can instantly answer support requests simply by setting up an email inbox. However, email lacks many of the capabilities needed by today's support operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>An email inbox is 'one size fits all.' It does not allow you to easily view specific requests by designated groups or individuals.</li>
<li>Email is not able to remind you when a question has been left unanswered for too long.</li>
<li>Multiple agents sharing an inbox may respond to the same question, often with different answers.</li>
<li>You must manually update customers when problems are solved or to request satisfaction feedback.</li>
<li>If your email provider is having problems with their servers, you will not receive new support requests or be able to respond in a timely manner.</li>
<li>As your customers increasingly use smartphones, tablets, and social media to communicate, your email inbox cannot handle questions sent via text messages, phone calls, live chats, or tweets.</li>
<li>Emails have a tendency to get buried and searching for them can be very time consuming.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the single biggest drawback to email is how easily you can lose track of a conversation with a customer. Emails get accidentally deleted, people get added and removed from email chains, and each email is tied to the inbox it was sent to, meaning you cannot easily work on an email with a colleague. You cannot track overall customer question themes, time spent by agents on each support question, or automatically route emails to the right department. Email is not reliable and these limitations will become exponentially more painful as your customer base grows.</p>
<h2>Cloud-Based Software Wholly Focused on Customer Support</h2>
<p>Your customer support organization can expect to save both time and energy by using a customer service platform to streamline your current email support processes. Zendesk is cloud-based customer service software that can instantly raise your customer support efficiency through dozens of built-in automations that work right out of the box. With so many built-in efficiencies, you are freed from trying to set up complicated labeling systems or other ways of organizing your email in an inbox.</p>
<p>Zendesk manages support requests by creating what is known as a ticket. A ticket is simply a record of all conversations; it keeps everything in one place and keeps your whole team in the loop. By creating a series of recorded events tied to one ticket, agents and customers can stay on the same page. This also creates a level of accountability that can ensure each problem is solved quickly. Furthermore, a ticket creates a full audit trail that can give you insight into how your support agents are spending their working hours.</p>
<p>All tickets are visible and can be tracked by the account owner from start to finish. You can give and restrict access to various parts of your support infrastructure as you see fit. With email alone, you are not able to easily access the requests that individual agents are handling, but in Zendesk you have full transparency into how your organization is working. Having full visibility into the customer support process allows you to understand what happens on a daily basis in your organization.</p>
<h2>Email Functionality From Day One</h2>
<p>Zendesk works with the support email addresses you've already set up, so your customers will not notice any change in how they communicate with your business. Instead, they will notice a much more communicative and transparent customer support experience.</p>
<h4><i>Figure 1 - Setting Up Email Forwarding in Outlook</i></h4>
<p><img class="clear" alt="" src="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/images/p-resources/whitepaper-email-2.png"/></p>
<p>Most customers prefer to receive email on their own domain address rather than using the Zendesk provided address. This is perfectly understandable, and 100% supported. This means that you can accept email on e.g. help@mycompany.com and forward it to your account on support@mycompany.zendesk.com.</p>
<p>A customer who sends you an email will instantly be notified that their request has been received, reassuring them that their email will be responded to quickly. This creates accountability. You can create time-based triggers that will automatically escalate unanswered support requests. Your customers will be notified when their request is considered 'solved' by the support agent and is given the option to reopen the ticket if they should need to later. All these steps would have to be done manually with email alone, but with Zendesk they are completely automatic.</p>
<p>If you receive the same type of email questions repeatedly, you can set up Zendesk macros, which are standard responses to frequently asked questions. Macros allow agents to respond to common issues with just one click, which significantly increases productivity. Each of your support agents can have their own personal macros to save time and still maintain their personal support style or expertise.</p>
<p>Zendesk is cloud-based and has a 99.9% service uptime. If you have access to the Internet, it is virtually guaranteed you have full access to your Zendesk and your customer support requests. Zendesk even has mobile apps for iPad, iPhone, Blackberry, Kindle Fire, Windows 7, and Android that ensure you are able to respond to your customers no matter where you are!</p>
<h2>How Does Email Work and Look Inside Zendesk?</h2>
<p>If you already have a support email address you use for customers, simply start forwarding all the incoming mail to your default Zendesk support email address. If you don't yet have a support email address, you will be provided with one when you sign up for Zendesk, such as support@mycompany.zendesk.com. You can publish this support email address on your website, business cards, or any other asset that you think would make it easier for customers to contact you with questions.</p>
<p>From the moment you start forwarding your support email, all your communications will be housed in your Zendesk. You will be able to search for and access tickets, chat transcripts, and any other support requests you've received whenever you may need.</p>
<p>You have the choice whether you'd like to use your email or login to Zendesk to interact with your customers. You can respond to tickets directly from Zendesk or your email client, such as Outlook or Gmail. Depending on your settings, you will also be automatically notified by Zendesk when a customer has responded to a ticket.</p>
<p>When a customer email is sent to your server, it is forwarded along to Zendesk's cloud-based servers. The forwarded email will be automatically converted into an unsolved ticket and inside your Zendesk, it will show up in your Views menu. To see unsolved tickets, select over the View tab on the top navigation of the Zendesk interface.</p>
<h4><i>Figure 2 - Zendesk Menu — 'Views' Tab</i></h4>
<p><img class="clear" alt="" src="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/images/p-resources/TamingEmailFig2.png"/></p>
<p>You can think of Views as multiple inboxes for your support tickets — they can be set up for different types of requests or for agents who handle a certain type of question or are an expert for a specific product. One of the default Views is called 'My Unsolved Tickets,' which houses any ticket that you haven't yet marked as solved.</p>
<h4><i>Figure 3 - Zendesk Unsolved Tickets View</i></h4>
<p><img class="clear" alt="" src="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/images/p-resources/TamingEmailFig3.png"/></p>
<p>When you want to respond to the customer, simply answer their question and click the submit button in the lower right hand corner. This will update the ticket with all the changes you've made and send the reply to the customer. Zendesk returns you to your Unsolved Ticket View with a message that you've updated your ticket.</p>
<h2>What a Customer Sees</h2>
<p>When your customers send you emails, they will automatically receive acknowledgement. Later, when your support team has responded, they will receive an email with the full agent response. Customers will not be left wondering if their email got to the right person; both you and your customers will have a record of every interaction. When your support agent has marked the ticket as solved, the customer will be notified and given the option to follow up if needed. You can also set up your Zendesk to automatically send a customer satisfaction survey to gauge the helpfulness of the agent, giving you insight into the performance of your support agents.</p>
<h2>How a Customer Responds</h2>
<p>Your customers can respond directly to your email from their personal email account, just like they always have. You can optionally set up your Zendesk to require customers sign into your customer support portal. This can be helpful to direct customers to knowledge bases, customer communities, or other documentation that may answer their questions. Zendesk supports Single Sign-On (SSO) with many third-party user authentication or directory access services, including Active Directory, SAML, Google, and Facebook.</p>
<h2>How Zendesk Keeps Customers Up-To-Date And Saves You Time</h2>
<p>Using Zendesk is fast and simple, by design. However, you may like to know what Zendesk does automatically when a customer sends you an email.</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer's email travels from their email provider's server to your email server and a copy of the email is forwarded to Zendesk's servers.</li>
<li>Zendesk automatically replies to the customer email with a customizable acknowledgment of receipt.</li>
<li>The email is converted into a support ticket and the system applies rules you have set up to apply to this ticket.</li>
<li>If designated, the ticket can be automatically assigned to an agent or another user can manually assign it.</li>
<li>When the agent marks the ticket as solved, the customer will receive another email acknowledging the closure of the ticket. The customer is free to reopen the case at any time simply by replying to the email.</li>
<li>Optionally, you can also have a customer satisfaction survey sent to the customer to evaluate the effectiveness of your support agents.</li>
</ul>
<h4><i>Figure 4 - Example of Customer Satisfaction Survey</i></h4>
<p><img class="clear" alt="" src="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/images/p-resources/whitepaper-email-4.png"/></p>
<h2>Importing Your Current Emails and Tickets</h2>
<p>Migrating your existing emails to your new Zendesk help desk is easy. Our engineers have built a robust API, including a Mail API that is designed to import backlogs of tickets, emails, and other collateral you may have in your existing system. Setting up this data migration will require a bit of work on your side since most email systems work slightly differently, but the key is that you have the flexibility to add your existing collection of emails to Zendesk from day one.</p>
<h2>Reporting Lets You Make Decisions Based On Live Data</h2>
<p>Support has different levels — while you can see a lot from the ground level, some things are only visible from a higher plain and Zendesk Reports give you the tools to understand how your customer support functions. This is helpful to see larger trends and patterns in your workflow. For instance, you might want to know how many tickets came in over the past week about a specific issue; or how many problem tickets got created last month vs. how many got solved.</p>
<p>Zendesk is preloaded with the most frequently used report templates to help you retrieve the important information you need to keep your help desk running smoothly. For example, you can run a 'Resolution Times' report that measures how quickly incoming issues are being resolved. Within the 'Reports' tab of Zendesk, you can set the data sets you'd like to monitor and set the span of time you'd like to see a report on. For more information on building reports, see <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/entries/20116851" target="_blank">Monitoring ticket activity</a> and agent performance with reports.</p>
<h4><i>Figure 5 - Data Set Menu in Zendesk</i></h4>
<p><img class="clear" alt="" src="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/images/p-resources/TamingEmailFig5DataSet.png"/></p>
<p>Like any high-level tool, Zendesk Reports is most useful when reviewed regularly. Building a resolution time report and ticket backlog report, then integrating them into a weekly meeting or performance review, is a recommended best practice. You can also get insight into how your Zendesk is running by viewing data in the Reporting dashboard. The Reporting dashboard shows data about your ticket volume and management, community activity, and agent performance. It also enables you to compare key ticket metrics within your Zendesk, and <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/entries/21999767-Using-the-Reporting-dashboard" target="_blank">further compare your Zendesk to industry averages</a>.</p>
