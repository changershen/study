<div class="resource-body">
<div class="resource-body-content animate-slideup ungated">
<p>Phone support is a powerful way to help your customers. But standalone phone systems, separate from other support channels, can negatively impact support operations. Agents are forced to switch between systems, which makes it difficult to keep track of customer interactions.<br/>
 <br/>
In this on-demand webinar, hear how Dorm Room Movers, a fast-growing shipping, storage and moving company, switched from a siloed phone system to <a href="www.zendesk.com/voice">Zendesk Voice</a>. By making this move to integrated phone support, they created a single, seamless platform for customer communication.<br/>
 <br/>
Matthew Grossman, co-founder and COO of Dorm Room Movers, and Ryan Nichols, General Manager of Zendesk Voice, discuss how Zendesk Voice helped Dorm Room Movers to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Consolidate software systems, boost agent productivity, and reduce operational costs</li>
<li>Gain full visibility into the customer journey and provide more personal service</li>
<li>Centralize reporting for comprehensive analytics and improved forecasting</li>
</ul>

Despite the rise of newer channels like social media and email, many customers still prefer the immediacy and real-time interaction that’s possible with the 1:1 interaction of a phone call. According to Forrester Research, <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Channel+Management+Core+To+Your+Customer+Service+Strategy/-/E-RES118001">73% of consumers</a> have used phone support in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>While many companies are adopting strategies and infrastructure to provide great customer service via newer channels, they are still making the investment in phone support. That’s the good news.</p>
<p>The bad news: too many companies are using phone support solutions that are separate from their other support channels, creating a silo around phone support. Treating phone support as a standalone support channel creates major problems, for everyone involved:</p>
<p><strong>Agents - impacted productivity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Agents must switch between separate platforms for different support channels, slowing time to resolution
<li>Agents must deliver phone support without a complete view of the customer’s cross-channel experience, making it difficult to provide personalized service
<li>Agents must manually enter the details of a phone call or not log the call at all
</ul>
<p><strong>Managers - limited visibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Managers lack visibility into their phone support operations if agents don’t log calls
<li>Managers cannot easily gain insight into how their phone support fits into multichannel support strategies without centralized reporting
</ul>
<p><strong>IT/Owners - additional set-up and management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Setup can be costly and may require additional integrations or equipment
<li>IT must work with multiple vendors
</ul>
<p><strong>Customers - negative experiences</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Customers are kept waiting as agents switch between systems
<li>Customers receive inconsistent service across channels, as agents don’t have visibility into customers’ complete cross-channel interactions
</ul>
<p>The solution is simple: integrated phone support</p>
<h2>Benefits of integrated phone support</h2>
<p>Luckily, all of the above issues are mitigated or outright solved by taking phone support out of the silo and integrating it with other support channels. With integrated phone support, customer service teams can manage all support channels from a single, centralized support system.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the three main problems and address each one:</p>
<h3>Agents - boost productivity</h3>
<p>If agents need to switch through several systems for each support channel might, those seconds add up throughout the day, greatly hindering an agent’s overall productivity. A consolidated customer communication system solves this: now agents don’t need to switch systems when responding to different support channels. It also give them full visibility into the customer’s activities across all channels, enabling the agent to provide personalized service. </p>
<p>Integrated phone support should include automatic ticket creation, call recording and customer history, so agents aren’t forced to manually take notes or search several systems of record for information about the customer. Everything happens automatically and exists in a single location, so agents have the context they need and the freedom to truly focus on the customer call. Plus outbound calls from existing tickets automatically update that ticket, keeping all multi-channel interactions in one place.</p>
<h3>Managers - improve visibility</h3>
<p>Managers require clear visibility into their customer service health—both of individual agents and the department as a whole—to improve performance and plan for the future. This is not feasible when phone support is managed through a system separate from other support channels. </p>
<p>Two distinct systems of record that don’t “speak” to each other—one for a call records (which only include phone and provides insights like average call time and number of calls each agent handles an hour) and a ticket record—make it impossible to gain comprehensive insights into all channels and plan accurately for the future. </p>
<p>Integrated phone support lets managers understand the performance of the entire channel mix, including:</p>
<li>What percentage of support tickets are through the phone
<li>Which types of issues drive phone calls vs. emails vs. chat, etc., enabling managers to strategize ways to reduce calls or divert support requests to other channels, reducing costs and improving efficiencies
<li>How to best train, hire, and distribute staff. If managers know they need more top-notch phone support agents, they can plan accordingly<br/>
<h3>Owners/IT - consolidate systems and reduce costs</h3>
<p>With integrated phone support—specifically a phone support solution that’s built into a customer support platform—IT is able to work with one trusted vendor for all support channels. Furthermore, phone support systems that integrate with other channels are typically VoIP solutions, which come with the additional benefits of reduced equipment and maintenance costs, portability and flexibility.</p>
<h3>Customers - better experiences</h3>
<p>The most important reason to adopt integrated phone support is because it’s better for customers. It allows companies to provide customers with exactly what they want: quick, consistent, personalized service.</p>
<p>First and foremost, customers want customer service to be fast. As mentioned earlier, the seconds can really add up when agents are forced to switch back and forth between different systems to reference interactions while on the phone with a customer. Integrated phone support means agents will have ready access to that information, leading to faster service. Integrated phone support means agents don’t have to keep customers waiting or worse, put them on hold while they search for information that straddles different systems.</p>
<p>Customers also want service from knowledgeable agents, and they want it to feel personal. When phone support lives in a silo, agents lack access to previous interactions with the customer and other context. But with integrated phone support, agents will not only know who is calling (thanks to CTI screen pops), they can also see if the customers has any outstanding tickets in other channels, previously closed tickets, purchase history, and more. All of which makes it easier for the agent to treat the customer like an individual. </p>
<h2>Selecting a vendor</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve made the decision to give your customers the best possible service with integrated phone support, here is a quick primer to help you choose the best vendor:</p>
<h3>Support platform integration</h3>
<p>Look for a phone system that fits into your agents’ workflows, complementing other channels. Agents should work from a single platform, and managers should have a full-view into support operations. Seek a telephony system that is built in to the support platform, limiting need for any custom integration work and reducing the number of software vendors.</p>
<h3>Inbound screen popping</h3>
<p>For inbound calls, receiving pop-up alerts with a link to the contact’s record in your CRM puts essential information at agents’ fingertips. This is especially useful for organizations focused on customer service and support so that you can provide a personalized experience. </p>
<h3>Customer history</h3>
<p>Contact details, including custom user and organization fields, as well as full multi-channel support history, should be at the agent's' fingertips during a call for easy reference. Knowing what other issues a customer may be facing leads to faster resolution and consistent cross-channel support.</p>
<h3>Automatic ticket creation</h3>
<p>It is essential that you choose something that keeps track of calls and voicemails with automatic ticket creation, eliminating the need for manual data entry. Plus, tickets can serve as a data source for quality assurance, agent training, and customer feedback.</p>
<h3>Call analytics</h3>
<p>Call activity reporting with real-time performance analytics and dashboards are essential to monitor productivity. You will also want to make sure that it is easy to do historical reporting and analysis across your channels. </p>
<h3>Call recording</h3>
<p>You should have the ability to record all inbound and outbound calls made from any device associated with the system. These recordings should be easily accessible directly in the contact record and easy to share with other agents for training and quality assurance. </p>
<h3>
Routing and automatic call distribution</h3>
<p>Ensure your phone support system will route callers to the right agent or department with routing tools like IVR (interactive voice response) systems and group routing. Round robin call distribution will ensure that calls are always routed to an available agent and evenly distributed among support team members.</p>
<h3>Flexibility & customization</h3>
<p>It’s important to seek a vendor that offers the flexibility to work with the systems you have in place and doesn’t require purchasing any additional software or hardware. It should be easy to customize for your team’s specific use cases and workflows, without the help of consultants or technicians.</p>
<h3>
Ease of use</h3>
<p>Since agents and managers will work with this tool for many hours at a time, it’s mandatory that you choose something that’s simple to use and designed with the user in mind.</p>

<div class="resource-body">
<div class="resource-body-teaser"><p>Did you know that the average person will spend 43 days of his or her life waiting on hold? It's true, scientific fact.</p>
<p>That's a lot of time spent waiting to speak to a customer service rep, listening to some third-rate cover of ‘Careless Whisper.’ When we found out about this we were like, “Now just hold on a minute…” (pun totally intended). Tormenting people with saxophone Muzak is no way to treat customers. That's why we hired a professional musician to compose a new song, one that the hold music-listening public voted as the best hold music. </p>

<p>Phone support is the black sheep of today's multi-channel support world. Poorly trained staff, misguided processes, and confusing phone systems have all eroded the user experience. On the business side, legacy systems were complex, expensive, and took a long time (and a lot of help) to set up. These factors worked against small and midsize businesses, in particular, who need to be able to quickly scale as business expands.</p>
<p>Yet research continues to show that consumers often prefer the phone to other channels. A phone call makes consumers feel acknowledged, and it's a sure-fire way to get their problem resolved, faster. Still, many smaller and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) shy away from offering phone support.</p>
<p>The truth is that phone support is both a vital and practical part of a multi-channel support strategy. And advances in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology now make phone support both affordable and easy to manage.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll look explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>some of the common misconceptions people have about phone support</li>
<li>research that explains why phone support so important for SMBs</li>
<li>how easy it is to set up a <a href="/voice/call-center-software/virtual-call-center/">call center</a> using an integrated VoIP system</li>
<li>tips for training and coaching new phone support agents</li>
<li>the most important metrics to track to make your phone support effective</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why phone support gets a bad rap</h2>
<p>Many people have nightmarish stories about navigating an interactive voice response (IVR) menu, or being stuck on hold only to have the call dropped. The experience makes a liar of that soothing, upbeat voice assuring them that their 'call is very important.' While IVRs, hold music, and menus intend to help callers navigate support options, they often have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Add to these frustrations the fact that phone support is often outsourced. Staff at large call centers may not feel empowered to truly help customers, and may feel disconnected. The whole situation leaves consumers with a bad taste in their mouth.</p>
<p>Customer horror stories are exacerbated by old technology. A small or midsize business evaluating the potential of phone support just sees a poor user experience and difficult implementation. Phone support doesn’t seem worth it. In fact, phone support seems like a last resort.</p>
<h2>Go for quality, not quantity</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many large phone support organizations focus on minimizing downside rather than maximizing satisfaction, which is why phone support is often arduous. A <a title="McKinsey Quarterly article" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/maintaining_the_customer_experience" target="_blank">McKinsey Quarterly article</a> exemplifies this strategy through its findings at a wireless telecommunications provider. After rigorous analysis, the telecommunications provider considered raising service levels to the "delight breakpoint" or reducing them to just above the "patience threshold." Customer-lifetime-value economics pointed to the second option.</p>
<p>Yet for SMBs, which don't often encounter the same volume-related challenges that large organizations do, helping customers reach the "delight breakpoint" can be a powerful weapon in the fight for market share. Great service helps create brand advocates—loyal customers who evangelize a company's product(s) to others. Brand advocates help businesses grow without increasing sales and marketing spending. It’s a mistake a lot of companies make—under-investing in customer-retention spending. <a title="Research revealed" href="http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/7/18/customer_retention.html" target="_blank">Research revealed</a> that brands who increase customer retention rates by as little as 5% can increase profits by 25-95%.</p>
<p>In fact, <a title="a Deloitte study" href="http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/Consumer%20Business/US_CP_BrandAdvocatesStudy_020910.pdf" target="_blank">a Deloitte study</a> showed that brand advocates spend more than twice as much as regular consumers on average. In this way, providing exemplary service to an existing customer base can help small and midsize companies see a return on customer support investments.</p>
<p>Before you can create brand advocates, you must communicate with your customers on their channel of choice.</p>
<h2>Customers (still) prefer phone conversations</h2>
<p>In Forrester’s “Global 2011 Consumer Preference Report—Contact Centers” study, phone conversations trumped email interactions by a ratio of nearly three to one. To explain this, the study asked respondents to prioritize what they desired in a customer service interaction. Quick resolution and human interaction topped the list:</p>
<ol>
<li>"I am able to interact with a customer service representative quickly."</li>
<li>"My query is resolved quickly."</li>
<li>"I am able to interact with a person."</li>
<li>"I am able to access the information I need to resolve my query myself."</li>
<li>"The customer service representative is based in this country."</li>
</ol>
<p>The reasons provided by the respondents are perhaps the most revealing takeaway from this study, especially as time marches on and live chat, social media, and self-service options continue to evolve and claim larger (<a title="and fluctuating" href="http://www.avaya.com/usa/resource/assets/premiumcontent/The_Autonomous_Customer_Survey_2013.pdf" target="_blank">and fluctuating</a>) portions of the <a title="multi-channel" href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/a-guide-to-multi-channel-customer-support/" target="_blank">multi-channel</a> pie.</p>
<p>More recent findings confirm that <a title="voice is still the primary channel" href="http://blogs.forrester.com/kate_leggett/13-01-14-forresters_top_15_trends_for_customer_service_in_2013" target="_blank">voice is still the primary channel</a> for customer service, and findings from our internal <a title="Zendesk Customer Service Benchmark" href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/customer-service-benchmark/" target="_blank">Zendesk Customer Service Benchmark</a> in the third quarter of 2013 revealed that the phone actually yields the highest customer satisfaction rating. Compared with service provided via email, chat, web self-service, Twitter and Facebook, a whopping <a title="91% of customers were satisfied with service provided via phone" href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Zendesk_Benchmark_2013Q3.pdf" target="_blank">91% of customers were satisfied with service provided via phone</a>.</p>
<h2>How phone support should operate</h2>
<p>Effective phone support should be simple. Telephony systems should be intuitive, and help speed resolution. And operational efficiency requires a blend of well-trained, empowered staff using intelligent, well-designed tools.</p>
<p>Here's a look at how phone support should ideally operate:</p>
<p><strong>Calls are fielded in-house.</strong> Research shows that in-house employees are more knowledgeable, dedicated, and have less turnover than outsourced agents.</p>
<p><strong>Agents have resolution authority.</strong> Research also shows that empowering agents to make crucial decisions on their own speeds resolution and increases job and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Your phone system facilitates productivity.</strong> A phone system should have the following features or functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seamless integration with other channels</strong>: Syncs with a customer support platform to prevent data loss, to show agents past interactions, to automatically log call information in tickets or to attach call information to related tickets, including tickets generated from other channels.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to install</strong>: Up and running in minutes, not days, with no complicated hardware or outside help needed.</li>
<li><strong>Affordable</strong>: No setup costs, with commitment-free, pay-as-you-go billing.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic call routing</strong>: Routes calls to the next open agent so that customers don’t deal with confusing or complex menus.</li>
<li><strong>Voicemail</strong>: Allows customers to leave voicemails during off hours or when all agents are busy; voicemail messages should let customers know when they can expect a return call.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong>: Presents relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) in an easily digestible format.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Let KPIs drive decisions.</strong> Phone systems with a great reporting dashboard should give you call stats that allow you to tweak performance and spot trends.</p>
<p><strong>Collect customer feedback.</strong> It’s helpful to send out regular surveys that measure customer satisfaction and to invite feedback that will help you improve.</p>
<p>Phone support can and does operate this way for many SMBs—especially using new technology. It’s no longer an uphill climb to set yourself up for ideal operation.</p>
<h2>Implement a call center in minutes</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are four key steps to implementing phone support, detailed in the sections below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a phone system</li>
<li>Set up the system</li>
<li>Implement a trial period</li>
<li>Go live</li>
</ol>
<h3>Choose a phone system</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There are three main types of phone systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legacy</strong>: Analog phone systems delivered through traditional phone lines</li>
<li><strong>VoIP</strong>: Digital phone systems delivered via the Internet</li>
<li><strong>Integrated VoIP</strong>: VoIP systems that link to a customer service platform</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Legacy systems have historically involved expensive hardware and professional setup, and don't scale easily. VoIP systems are more flexible because of their web delivery, and don’t require any hardware beyond a computer and headset. However, traditional VoIP systems lack one key component: customer support software integration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Integrated VoIP systems work in tandem with customer service platforms by linking calls to customer data. Calls are logged in tickets and attached to customer profiles, making it easy to cross-reference a new call with all old conversations—whether they happened on the phone, via chat, or otherwise. Integrated VoIP systems also offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-browser or handset calling</strong>: Agents can take calls using either a computer and headphones, or an IP phone</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The system can adjust to changes in volume by adding or subtracting lines with minimal effort</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, you should be able to try a VoIP system for free, and with no up-front commitment.</p>
<h3>Set up the system</h3>
<p dir="ltr">With the right phone system, setup requires limited configuration and no outside help. You’ll want to establish:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Available hours</strong>: Start with your current business hours and evolve according to customer feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Hold message or music</strong>: It easy to start out with a simple, universal soundtrack and then adjust, if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum hold time before voicemail</strong>: As a starting point, two minutes is a good rule of thumb.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Focus on making the customer experience as simple and straightforward as possible. If you use menus, limit options to only those that are absolutely necessary for ensuring proper call routing. Let friends and employees test the process before pushing it live to customers.</p>
<h3>Start with a trial period</h3>
<p dir="ltr">It's important not to overwhelm support staff when trying phone support for the first time. We recommend a one-month trial period, divided into two-week phases.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Phase 1</strong> - Opt for a slow rollout to a handpicked set of customers. Begin by emailing them a short message about the new service. Use these first two weeks to ease staff into the support process (see the section on training and coaching below). Conduct weekly meetings to gather feedback. This feedback can help you tweak initial processes before the second phase.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Phase 2</strong> - In the second half of the trial period, take a closer look at volume and issue type using the system's reporting dashboard. Use this information to gauge staffing needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of the trial period is determining which customers you should support. This is a crucial decision that depends largely on business goals and product type. For example, consumer goods businesses typically support all customers via phone, whereas service companies may offer phone support to only a particular customer subgroup, such as those with billing issues, or more complex technical problems.</p>
<h3>Go live</h3>
<p dir="ltr">To take your phone support live, announce the new support option via email. Also ensure that the support number is posted on your website, and any relevant social media profiles, if voice support is available to all customers. It’s important to clearly communicate your support hours or to clarify the type of phone support you’re offering (e.g., billing inquiries only). Sometimes a new channel of support needs to be marketed before it gains traction, but it’s best to be prepared for a surge in volume once you go live. Zendesk saw a 40% increase in weekly calls after posting our support number on our site.</p>
<h2>Train and coach agents for success</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Taking calls for the first time can be nerve-wracking. Agents never know what a customer will say, and every call is different. That’s why the best way to train an agent for voice support is to take things slow. At Zendesk, new agents don’t answer calls for one to two months after they're hired.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once live, phone agents do a lot at once: actively listen, soothe customers, create tickets, and research answers—often at breakneck speed. Agents should feel confident before flying solo, so here are a few tips to help ease them in:</p>
<ul>
<li>New agents should receive standard onboarding and product training, followed by more intensive training on the tools required to provide support.</li>
<li>Before diving into phone support, agents must be adept at creating tickets, searching for product information, and using your customer service software. For this reason, it's a good idea to have phone agents begin with email support. This gives them time to learn, research, and dig into your product and tools. You want their online tasks to come as second nature as agents listen to customers.</li>
<li>Next, have agents listen in on calls and shadow other phone agents to see how they speak and respond to customers.</li>
<li>Always check in with agents before putting them on the phone and don’t push. It’s important the agent feels comfortable.</li>
<li>When the agent is ready, have them start by handling voicemails. Without the pressure of a live call, the agent can take time to listen and figure out what the customer needs. Then they can research the answer before returning the call. Someone with more experience should be listening or available to jump in with coaching or support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always give your agents the green light to put the customer on hold if they need more time to find an answer or to ask for help.</p>
<p>Once your agents are comfortable, give them the authority to make decisions. Trust agents to handle calls without having to put customers on hold to ask for a manager's permission or approval before continuing with a resolution.</p>
<h2>Stats you should be tracking</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Once support is live, it's important to track KPIs to ensure that everything is running smoothly and to detect troubling trends. The phone system's reporting dashboard should aid this process by keeping track of a few key stats, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Total call volume</strong> – Total number of calls in a given time period. Look out for drastic swings up or down. This is a signal that there might be a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Per-agent call volume</strong> – Total number of calls per agent in a given time period. Look out for parity across staff in the same role. This should remain consistent over time or increase slowly.</li>
<li><strong>Average call time</strong> – Average time agents spend on the phone across all calls. Aim to keep this low, while focusing on customer satisfaction. Quick is nice, but pleased is better.</li>
<li><strong>Average turnaround time</strong> – Average time it takes to resolve an issue. Generally, the faster, the better. Try to or exceed match other channels.</li>
<li><strong>First-call resolution rate</strong> – Percentage of issues resolved on the first call. Higher is better, but complex issues may necessitate multiple interactions—judge accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Abandonment rate</strong> – Percentage of calls abandoned before answering. This rate should be as low as possible. Lower the maximum wait time if abandonment rises, and work on speeding resolution by having staff ready to jump in and help out during times when this rate spikes. If you find it spikes with regularity, you may need to add additional staff.</li>
<li><strong>Average speed to answer</strong> – Average time agents take to answer a call (including hold time). Try to keep as low as possible. Voicemail should be set to trigger a few seconds after the average time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t be intimidated. If you’re unfamiliar with these stats, start slowly and use basic call volume and average call time to determine appropriate staffing levels. Then revisit the remaining stats in a few months, once you’re more comfortable.</p>
<h3>Ask your customers how you're doing</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The ultimate measuring stick for phone support is customer satisfaction, so whenever possible, find ways to gather feedback. Great phone systems and customer service software will provide a simple electronic feedback mechanism, but it may also be necessary to seek more advanced methods, such as callback or email surveys. Remember to ask your customers for improvement opportunities. Then, as trends emerge, prioritize and implement the suggestions that make the most sense for your business.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We live in a fast-paced, multi-channel world where customers expect an immediate response. Smaller companies have to compete with their larger competition, which underscores why phone support is an ideal tool for SMBs looking to increase customer satisfaction and drive word-of-mouth marketing. Thanks to advances in technology, it's now possible to lower your costs and to manage multiple channels from a centralized platform. And this, in turn, makes it possible for any business of any size to offer first-class support.</p>

<h1>The Evolution of Phone Support</h1>
</a>

<div class="resource-body">
<div class="resource-body-content animate-slideup ungated">
<p>On a scale of 1 to 10, one being 'please, anything but that' and 10 being 'this is the best thing that might have ever happened to me,' how much do you like picking up the phone and calling customer service? We'd venture to say the majority of the answers would hover around the lower end of the scale (with some wishing that negative numbers were also an option).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's a bit of a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/bleep-support-agents-say/" target="_blank">stigma</a> around being a customer service rep. Yet, a recent customer service survey conducted by callcentres.net and Forrester Consulting found that most folks <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/why-zendesk/whitepaper/how-to-conquer-your-fear-of-phone-support/" target="_blank">pick up the phone</a> more than any other channel when they need help. Even more compelling, 79 percent of those surveyed listed voice conversations among their preferred support channel (only 33 percent said email).</p>
<p>Clearly there's something about talking to a good ol' fashioned human being that's hard to beat. It's why Zendesk recently launched its <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/product/features/voice/" target="_blank">Voice feature</a>, which gives both customers and support agents a reason to pick up the phone instead of hanging it up.</p>
<p>It's phone support for the 21st century. Let's take a look at how we got here!</p>

<h1>Killing phone support can kill your business </h1>

</header>
 
<div class="resource-body">
<div class="resource-body-content animate-slideup ungated">
<p>No one relishes the thought of having to phone up a support agent to have their issue resolved. The long hold times, the endless maze of menu options, and the dread of getting transferred to a dizzying stream of agents and having to retell your story every single time. Ugh.</p>
<p>But guess what? Companies don't relish the thought of phone support either.</p>
<p>As the infographic below shows, the cost of phone support and building out traditional call centers is expensive. The average cost of an inbound call is $5.90. Sounds pretty low, until you consider that <a href="/voice/call-center-software/inbound-call-center/">call centers</a> on average field about 45.4 billion calls per year. And as their company grows and their number of support agents increases, it can be difficult to scale the kind of personal customer support they had at the beginning. Plus, building out call center can often take months to get ramped up and require and intense amount of training.</p>
<p>Yet, phone support continues to be the most popular support channel. Customers continue to have more faith that a live human being can help them more than anything else. And organizations know that phone support is a support channel they can't ignore. It's more trustworthy and makes it easy for customers to talk through what can be complex and technical issues. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/voice/" target="_blank">Zendesk Voice</a> is resolving the decades-long battle of making phone support an enjoyable, efficient, satisfying, and even fun experience. Yes, we said fun. It might be the most traditional channel for support, but it's finally time for having an untraditional way of tackling the enigma of how to provide successful phone support. Because phone support isn't going anywhere.</p>
