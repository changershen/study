<p>We know that customer engagement is at the forefront of conversation in the customer service space, and in 2015 industry leaders will continue to be challenged to innovate and engage customers across all support channels. In fact, today’s contact centers are tomorrow’s engagement centers.</p>
<p>A recent report by Gartner states, "No rallying principle in the enterprise matters more than the creation of superior customer engagement. IT leaders will need to innovate in engaging customers on all channels and have the metrics to choose the right projects."</p>
<p>Yet how can leaders in customer service continue to innovate, or choose the right projects?</p>
<p>Access your complimentary copy of the Gartner <em>Predicts 2015: Weak Mobile Customer Service Is Harming Customer Engagement</em> report to read Gartner's analysis and recommendations, based on the following strategic planning assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"By 2018, 5% of customer service cases will be initiated by Internet-connected devices, up from 0.02% in 2014."</li>
<li>"Over 100 of the 500 largest global businesses will introduce video-based chat by 2018 for customer-facing interactions."</li>
<li>"By 2017, one-third of all customer service interactions will still require the support of a human intermediary."</li>
<li>"By 2018, 75% of social-only customer service agents will be blended into the customer service agent pool."</li>
<li>"By 2018, 50% of agent interactions will be influenced by real-time analytics."</li>
</ul>

<h1>Tips for Providing Great Customer Service on Twitter</h1>
</a>
</header>
 
<div class="resource-body">
<div class="resource-body-teaser"><p>Much like the great Wizard of Oz, it's not always clear to consumers who, exactly, sits behind the curtain of a brand's Twitter profile, but they believe someone is there. For years companies have been pouring money into marketing and advertising on Twitter and have, effectively, taught customers to turn to the all powerful Tweet to get their questions answered as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Usage of Twitter for customer service is growing, perhaps more rapidly than any other social channel, but the level and quality of support provided across brands and industries is uneven, and there is clear room for improvement. A March 2013 study by Simply Measured reported that 99 percent of the Interbrand Top 100 brands now have an active Twitter handle, and 30 percent of those brands have dedicated support handles. While it's a promising start, only 10 percent of these brands responded to more than 70 percent of their contacts, and the average response rate overall was 42 percent.</p>
<p>Our tip sheet for providing support through Twitter includes suggestions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching for direct and indirect mentions of your brand</li>
<li>Using Twitter to promote other support channels</li>
<li>Learning the language and mastering the art of brevity</li>
<li>Using features such as direct messaging and lists</li>
<li>Hosting a Twitter Chat with your customers</li>
<li>and more!</li>

Any manager whose business thrives when customers are happy immediately understands the value of excellent customer service. The connection between customer satisfaction and future revenue is well established. The business challenge lies in providing exceptional customer service while at the same time maintaining cost-effective operations. The system used to support customer service has a significant impact on both business outcomes and costs.</p>
<p>Based on in-depth interviews with Zendesk customers, this paper investigates the value that customers have received from their investments in Zendesk, a cloud application for better customer service.</p>
<p>These customers reported significant, measurable operational savings from their use of Zendesk, in addition to gaining a wide range of qualitative business benefits. Frequently reported areas of quantifiable value include:</p>
<p> — Increased agent productivity<br/>
— Decreased ticket volume<br/>
— Avoided costs for in-house deployment</p>
<p>This paper also considers other key benefits experienced by Zendesk users including increased visibility, accountability, better customer service, and flexibility.</p>

<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">In Focus: Customer Satisfaction</strong><br/>
Across the globe, businesses are striving to improve customer satisfaction (CSAT) ratings. According to the most recent Zendesk Benchmark report, their efforts are paying off—customers around the world are relatively happy. In fact, the global customer satisfaction benchmark number for Q2 in 2015 was 94.94%. </p>
<p>So where in the world is customer satisfaction the highest? Find out in the <a href="//d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/resources/benchmarkQ22015_zz.pdf" target="_blank">Q2 2015 Zendesk Benchmark report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Movers and Shakers: Country and Industry Customer Satisfaction</strong><br/>
In country news, Turkey, Thailand, and Chile posted the greatest gains in customer satisfaction, while Belgium, Norway, and New Zealand ruled at the top. </p>
<p>Among industries, the top three CSAT-ranked industries remain Government & Non-profit, IT Services & Consultancy, and Healthcare. Most improved are Travel, Marketing & Communications, and Media & Telecommunications. </p>

This means that every business must consider the impact of offering (or not offering) customer support through multiple channels. It's safe to say there has been a "consumer awakening" and customers are now in charge. Enterprises who recognize this are poised to be the new 21st Century customer service heroes.</p>

<p>This paper describes why integrations of best-of-breed tools in the cloud will outperform standard all-in-one platforms. Cloud ecosystems that support the aggregation of superior software products will outclass traditional platforms that offer inferior products, however integrated. In other words, integrations of best-of-breed tools offer more to organizations and their customers than integrated suites of mediocre tools can. Simply put, SaaS is disrupting the traditional enterprise software market.</p>
<p>Today, intense focus on the customer is a fundamental way an organization can create what it wants most: customer satisfaction, loyalty, and increased business. Focusing on the customer means knowing them, understanding them, and responding to them. There's a vital place to do this: the front lines of sales and customer support. For an organization to be successful in this customer-centric climate, it must have the best tools available. These tools should provide easy access to key customer data throughout the entire customer lifecycle. With so much at stake in a fickle marketplace, it becomes clear that having the best products available — and not inferior offerings — is an absolute necessity.</p>
<p>The value of high-quality sales CRM software is obvious. The information captured within these systems, however, is primarily sales-centric. Therefore, the addition of customer support data represents a huge opportunity for increased awareness of customers. Together, the information captured by these two sources can provide organizations with the most complete view of customers possible. By seamless two-way integrations of best-of-breed tools in the cloud, an organization is primed for the best results: satisfied, loyal customers, and a thriving business.</p>
<p>How is this achieved? When an organization provides the best products available — and resists the urge to force customers into lesser solutions, as all-in-one platforms often do — customers feel well taken care of. That's the key component. Combining best-of-breed tools in the cloud delivers because by doing so, an organization demonstrates that it has the customer's best interests at heart.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>'In the physical world scarcity is what leads to value. In the digital world abundance is what leads to value.'<br/>
</i><br/>
— Fred Wilson, VC</p></blockquote>
<p>Zendesk offers several CRM integrations, including <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/product/features/salesforce/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/product/features/sugarcrm/" target="_blank">SugarCRM</a>, and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/product/features/microsoft-dynamics-crm-help-desk/" target="_blank">Microsoft Dynamics</a>.</p>
<h2>Why integrations of best-of-breed outperform all-in-one</h2>
<p>The debate is not new. The power of today's technology is. Terms, like the times, change. Since the dawn of web 2.0, even the term integration has been applied differently. Traditionally, integration has referred to multiple products within a legacy platform, such as Microsoft. Today, integration — or integrations — often refers to assembling different tools and solutions from multiple sources in the cloud.</p>
<p>Let's define our terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best-of-breed:</strong> the best available product of its type for a specific purpose</li>
<li><strong>All-in-one (aka platform):</strong> a set of products offered under one company umbrella</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best-of-breed vs. all-in-one</h2>
<p>The ideal way to illustrate the benefits of combining best-of-breed tools versus an all-in-one approach is by looking at sales and support systems. Together, sales and support establish the front lines of an organization. They represent the voice of customers internally (by conveying customer interactions to appropriate departments), and the voice of organizations externally with timely, informed, and coordinated communications.</p>
<p>Creating a great customer experience is the focal point of today's leading companies.</p>
<p>Therefore, establishing a customer-centric vision and tactical strategy is essential, and technology plays a critical role in providing the infrastructure and tools to implement this vision. It must be foundational to a company's daily processes, which are anchored by sales and support.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>81% of companies with strong capabilities and competencies for delivering customer experience excellence are outperforming their competition.<br/>
</i><br/>
— Peppers & Rogers Group, 2009 Customer Experience Maturity Monitor</p></blockquote>
<p>Without question, then, having the best products available for sales and customer support services and data is a must. And when these superior products are used in concert (see: School of Rock), with seamless integrations, the result is a huge win-win for organizations and their customers.</p>
<p>The above line is key: An ecosystem that employs several applications working together, fluidly. This is what delivers the best experience to customers. This is what will create customer satisfaction, influence product evangelism, and elevate the organizations that adopt this strategy: An ecosystem of integrated cloud solutions.</p>
<p>Still, some think that an all-in-one formula is the preferable option. They argue, why should we use another company if we can offer a product of our own? They champion the integration of products within their own systems (saying outside integrations are: A) expensive, and B) demanding) and believe keeping customers under one umbrella is better for the bottom line. Maybe. Or maybe not.</p>
<p>Consider: Does an all-in-one platform have the customer's best interests at heart?</p>
<blockquote><p><i>'Companies must demonstrate, in everything they do, that they have their customer's best interest at heart.'<br/>
</i><br/>
— MAi Research</p></blockquote>
<p>In today's environment, an all-in-one approach seems more concerned with corralling customers and keeping them contained than offering the best products and services available. Think back to Fred Wilson's quote. In the digital world, abundance is paramount. A philosophy based on scarcity or rigidity will not win the day.</p>
<p>With today's premiums on customer satisfaction so high, there's little chance these customers will remain loyal for the long term using lower-quality products — especially when superior products exist everywhere on the market.</p>
<p>And, because integrations between companies are more seamless than ever (with constantly updating and elegant APIs, SOA, etc.) worries about costs, maintenance, and usability are quickly becoming worries of the past.</p>
<h2>The logic of integrations</h2>
<p>Here's a simple analogy: A carpenter loads his tool belt with the best tools he knows. He doesn't care if his hammer is the same make as his screwdriver, what he cares about is having the best tools for the job.</p>
<p>The same logic can be applied to integrations of superior tools in the SaaS cloud. By employing the best available tools'such as the highest quality sales and customer service software on the market — a company, like a carpenter, equips itself to deliver an outstanding customer experience.</p>
<p>What's more, when an organization puts its customers first by combining best-of-breed tools — and not trying to force all-in-one solutions — customers put them first because they're so satisfied and delighted with the service and support they receive. When this happens, business thrives.</p>
<h2>The best-of-breed: sales CRM</h2>
<p>A sales CRM — a web-based customer relationship management (CRM) system — provides a great way to manage the relationships an organization has with its customers and prospects. A sales CRM enables a company to have detailed information about customer accounts in a centralized platform, and provides great value for the sales and marketing teams by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking from lead to close: capturing sales data in one place at every stage</li>
<li>Providing a view of customers: a picture of histories and sales interactions</li>
<li>Maintaining customer data: accounts, contacts, records, opportunities, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the last part of the sales cycle: closing a deal. It's a fragile step. A small error or miscommunication could threaten the deal's life. When salespeople know more about their customers, when they have access to detailed, real-time customer data, the process flows more smoothly and is much less prone to errors. Without the right information, a salesperson can be caught off guard.</p>
<p>Companies put huge effort and resources into every step of the sales cycle, from establishing leads to closing sales. For each step, it's critical that sales teams have as complete a view as possible of their customers. A sales CRM gives salespeople ready access to detailed customer information which helps them craft sales strategies that address clear needs based on what they know about their customers.</p>
<p>A sales CRM provides great sales data. It's built for that purpose. However, other key data exists. Without question, the more pertinent and rich customer data accessible the better, and nowhere within an organization is the opportunity to enhance the sales CRM data stronger than within customer service with customer support data. A salesperson will greatly enhance awareness of his customers and their interactions by incorporating another source — customer service data — into his sales CRM.</p>
<h2>Another source of customer data</h2>
<p>Another source of customer data comes from customer support interactions. Just imagine the awkwardness of an interaction between a salesperson and a customer when the customer has submitted multiple support requests — and the salesperson has no idea. What if a deal is ready to close and the salesperson isn't aware that problems have occurred? A customer will surely be turned off by an attempt to move forward. He'll feel ignored and, worse still, he'll assume his problems aren't known about.</p>
<p>This casts doubt on the level of communication within an organization as a whole, and creates serious customer dissatisfaction. The message would be: salespeople are only interested in closing deals and don't have the customer's best interests at heart.</p>
<p>This kind of situation can be avoided by making sure all needed and necessary information is available. The ability to deliver an exceptional customer experience and build lasting customer relationships will soar when integrations of best-of-breed sales CRM and customer service software are utilized. This is how to best serve the customer.</p>
<h2>The best-of-breed: customer service software</h2>
<p>Customer service software should transform how organizations engage with their customers. It must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to set up and easy to get started</li>
<li>Intuitive and straightforward</li>
<li>Focused on one thing: delivering exceptional customer support to customers</li>
</ul>
<p>This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy-to-use ticket management: </strong>Customer service teams need a tool that's built for customer engagement. It needs to be intuitive, with a beautiful and smart user interface that surfaces the information the agent needs and predicts their next-best action. Also, smart ticket management features should make delivering excellent customer service easy.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-channel:</strong> Meet customers where they are. E-mail, chat, phone, social media, community — every communication channel — needs to be available. Communicate with customers via their preferred channel — it's that simple.</li>
<li><strong>Self-service: </strong>Provide knowledge bases and communities. Make it easy to navigate and powerfully helpful. Allow customers to engage with each other and share opinions — to help each other — and provide an easy means to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Best practice workflows:</strong> Best practice workflows are built in, and should include automated notifications to customer and agent, for example, and be customizable. This includes the ability to set different SLAs (service level agreements), ease of sharing and escalating tickets, and options to collaborate on tickets and issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Powerful customer service software impacts how organizations engage with their customers. It captures vital information and facilitates good communication. Given the importance an organization has for both sales CRM and customer service software, the optimal solution should combine the best tools on the market for both, via seamless, two-way integrations. By doing so, the essential customer information required for an organization's long-term success is available within both applications.</p>
<h2>Integrations — a perfect match</h2>
<p>Bringing best-of-breed sales and customer service tools together enables full visibility into customer interactions. No time is spent looking for more information, it's right there. Salespeople and customer service people can focus on their main responsibility: providing an exceptional customer experience.</p>
<p>Customer service agents want the tools and information needed to answer questions and resolve problems on the spot, in the first interaction. This makes them excellent at their jobs, and ensures customer satisfaction. Plus, when customer service agents have a view into sales CRM data, customers get the sense that they are dealing with a single organization that knows them and cares about their concerns — holistically.</p>
<p>When two customers call in with an identical customer service issue, an agent can focus and adapt the service he gives each customer based on pertinent data learned from the sales CRM. He can see one customer is involved in a lengthy sales process, and the other has had no further contact with the company since the initial product purchase. This greatly informs and enhances the quality of the interaction and service.</p>
<p>If a company has the ability to see all interactions associated with a customer account at every point in the customer lifecycle, salespeople, agents and other users can make more intelligent decisions on how to approach and engage with each customer. Therefore, it makes sense to integrate sales CRM with agile, smart and convenient customer service software to gain magnified visibility into customers.</p>
<h2>The perfect match, made in the cloud</h2>
<p>When an organization wishes to build a thriving business it must employ the best software tools available. Today, a customer-focused approach is essential to an organization's success, and technology helps create what's wanted most: customer satisfaction, loyalty, and increased business. This can be achieved on the front lines of <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">sales and customer support with software products that provide easy access to all customer data and interactions throughout the entire customer lifecycle.</span></p>
<p>Many organizations use a sales CRM to capture sales information and manage accounts, but only specific types of information flow through these systems. By adding another tool to handle and track customer support interactions, another major source of information is now available. Together, these two systems can help organizations bridge gaps from sales to support, and provide more complete views of customers and their important interactions. These organizations are then poised to engage every customer based on specific needs. This will not only satisfy customers, this will delight them.</p>
<p>By seamless two-way integrations of best-of-breed tools, the best sales CRM can be amplified by the best customer service software. Customer support agents can access sales CRM customer data from within the customer service platform, and salespeople can access customer support data from within the sales CRM platform. By implementing both tools, an organization gets the best of both worlds.</p>
<h2>Customer case study: School of Rock</h2>
<p>When a new school opens, School of Rock delivers a suite of best-of-breed tools to get started and open its doors to students. School of Rock needed a customer service platform that not only fit this toolkit, but also delivered a great end-user experience while at the same time giving agents a system to be more effective. After evaluating several customer service platforms, School of Rock added Zendesk to its ecosystem that includes Google Apps, NetSuite, Box, and other cloud solutions.</p>
<p>With Zendesk, School of Rock has seen the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FRANCHISEE SATISFACTION RATING:</strong> 95%</li>
<li><strong>TICKET VOLUME REDUCTION:</strong> 42% decrease in number of tickets, from 378 tickets in March 2012 to 219 tickets in September 2012</li>
<li><strong>COST SAVINGS:</strong> 66% reduction in billable help desk hours from February 2012 to September 2012</li>
<li><strong>CUSTOMER NET PROMOTER SCORE:</strong> 63</li>

<h1>The Customer Service and Social Media Revolution</h1>
</a>
</header>
 
<div class="resource-body">
<div class="resource-body-content animate-slideup ungated">
<p>Customer service organizations face increasing amounts of pressure to deliver better service over a broader range of channels including the Web, email, and phone. Customers expect to get service at any time of the day or night and assume that customer service teams will maintain a complete history of all interactions.</p>
<p>More recently, the social network boom has created a new revolution in <a href="/customer-service-software/additional-features/social-media-customer-service/">customer service</a>. The reach and immediacy of Twitter, Facebook and, now, Google+ has made the voice of the customer an extremely powerful force. Bad customer experiences can quickly snowball into online customer uprisings leading to PR disasters.</p>
<p>In addition, the proliferation of smartphones and tablets has raised customer expectations for timely response. Customers now expect to reach companies from anywhere, at anytime, and through any device that they choose such as iPads, iPhones, and Blackberry and Android smartphones. While it used to be expected that customer inquiries would be answered in a couple days, now customers expect answers in hours, if not minutes.</p>
<p>As is often the case, tech-savvy startups are the first to embrace new technologies and communication channels. Larger, more traditional organizations are now finding that they need to develop new customer service strategies or else smaller, more nimble organizations may leave them in the dust and take their customers with them.</p>
<p>The exciting part of this ever-changing environment is that these new pressures have lead to both innovation and disruption in customer service.</p>
<h2>Customer Service Goes Social</h2>
<p>When traditional customer service software was developed, the pressures of supporting new and multiple online channels just didnt exist; the products were never designed to accommodate input from social media or run on mobile devices. As companies using these traditional solutions look to update their customer service software infrastructure to keep up with new channels, many realize that they cannot afford to expend 6-12 months to customize their current help desk solution if it were, indeed, even possible.</p>
<p>As a result, many companies are making the move to cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions. These have proven to be the fastest and most cost-effective alternative to updating on-premise packages. More importantly, these new cloud-based solutions are specifically designed for multi-channel customer service.</p>
<p>As an example, lets take a look at Twitter as a channel. Studies by Edison Research have indicated that 19% of Twitter users seek customer service via Tweets. With more than 200 million users, this means 38,000,000 customers are seeking service via Twitter. Modern customer service solutions have made this manageable by allowing companies to create custom searches for their brand names and product names on Twitter. When a problem is encountered, the Tweet can be immediately converted into a customer service ticket, known as a Twicket, in this case. The Twicket then can be assigned to the most appropriate person in the company to respond. That response can then be sent as a Tweet or a direct message.</p>
<h2>Customer Service Goes Mobile</h2>
<p>On the hardware side, customers and employees do more and more on mobile devices than ever before. In fact, the mobile revolution seems like an unstoppable force with more than 5.3 billion mobile subscribers worldwide (by the way, thats 77 percent of the worlds population).</p>
<p>Today the mobile consumer and the mobile workforce are rapidly converging. Whether officially sanctioned or not, many customer service employees already make use of their smart phones, iPads, and personal accounts like Twitter and Facebook to solve their customers' problems because these channels make their jobs easier.</p>
<p>Being able to access customer service systems from anywhere frees services teams from their desks. It allows them to respond to and escalate customer inquiries from anyplace at any time. As a result, response times go down and customer satisfaction goes through the roof. Time and time again, we see examples of customers who are delighted to get timely responses from inquiries whether theyre over the web, email, or Twitter. What matters is that youre taking care of the customer faster than ever before. In todays increasingly connected world, that wins customer loyalty and creates a huge competitive advantage.</p>
<h2>Multiple Channels, Unified Tools</h2>
<p>However, the more customer service channels a company supports, the more challenging it can be to effectively track and respond to customer inquiries. In addition, every new channel has the potential to create confusion for both customer service agents and customers. For example, one customer service agent may respond to a customer via email while another is communicating over Twitter. It can create the classic problem of the right hand not knowing what the left is doing.</p>
<p>To avoid these issues, companies need all their channels to feed into a central help desk with a unified set of business processes. While requests may arrive in different ways, the organization should strive for consistency across channels. This will reduce an overlap of efforts, ensure consistent responses, and simplify the management of the customer service team.</p>
<p>That is exactly how the new generation of help desk solutions are designed. In fact, they can truly provide the fastest way to a great customer experience because they are easy to set up, funnel interactions from multiple channels into a single place, and improve the efficiency of customer service agents.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Todays companies are faced with the challenge of having to deliver customer service across a wide variety of channels such as email, the Web, social media, and mobile devices; its not just about having a call center or FAX machine anymore. By supporting these channels, customer service organization have an amazing opportunity to deliver a truly memorable customer experience with the right processes and tools in place. If the last update you made to your customer service organizations was the addition of a support@ email address, it is probably time to seriously reassess your customer service strategy. Happy customers are loyal customers who not only keep coming back for more, but also spread the word about your company and products.</p>
<h2>About Zendesk</h2>
<p>Zendesk is the proven cloud-based help desk software that is the fastest way to enable great customer service in rapidly growing companies.
