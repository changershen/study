<h1>Key Benefits of Integrated Phone Support</h1>

Despite the rise of newer channels like social media and email, many customers still prefer the immediacy and real-time interaction that’s possible with the 1:1 interaction of a phone call. According to Forrester Research, <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Channel+Management+Core+To+Your+Customer+Service+Strategy/-/E-RES118001">73% of consumers</a> have used phone support in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>While many companies are adopting strategies and infrastructure to provide great customer service via newer channels, they are still making the investment in phone support. That’s the good news.</p>
<p>The bad news: too many companies are using phone support solutions that are separate from their other support channels, creating a silo around phone support. Treating phone support as a standalone support channel creates major problems, for everyone involved:</p>
<p><strong>Agents - impacted productivity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Agents must switch between separate platforms for different support channels, slowing time to resolution
<li>Agents must deliver phone support without a complete view of the customer’s cross-channel experience, making it difficult to provide personalized service
<li>Agents must manually enter the details of a phone call or not log the call at all
</ul>
<p><strong>Managers - limited visibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Managers lack visibility into their phone support operations if agents don’t log calls
<li>Managers cannot easily gain insight into how their phone support fits into multichannel support strategies without centralized reporting
</ul>
<p><strong>IT/Owners - additional set-up and management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Setup can be costly and may require additional integrations or equipment
<li>IT must work with multiple vendors
</ul>
<p><strong>Customers - negative experiences</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Customers are kept waiting as agents switch between systems
<li>Customers receive inconsistent service across channels, as agents don’t have visibility into customers’ complete cross-channel interactions
</ul>
<p>The solution is simple: integrated phone support</p>
<h2>Benefits of integrated phone support</h2>
<p>Luckily, all of the above issues are mitigated or outright solved by taking phone support out of the silo and integrating it with other support channels. With integrated phone support, customer service teams can manage all support channels from a single, centralized support system.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the three main problems and address each one:</p>
<h3>Agents - boost productivity</h3>
<p>If agents need to switch through several systems for each support channel might, those seconds add up throughout the day, greatly hindering an agent’s overall productivity. A consolidated customer communication system solves this: now agents don’t need to switch systems when responding to different support channels. It also give them full visibility into the customer’s activities across all channels, enabling the agent to provide personalized service. </p>
<p>Integrated phone support should include automatic ticket creation, call recording and customer history, so agents aren’t forced to manually take notes or search several systems of record for information about the customer. Everything happens automatically and exists in a single location, so agents have the context they need and the freedom to truly focus on the customer call. Plus outbound calls from existing tickets automatically update that ticket, keeping all multi-channel interactions in one place.</p>
<h3>Managers - improve visibility</h3>
<p>Managers require clear visibility into their customer service health—both of individual agents and the department as a whole—to improve performance and plan for the future. This is not feasible when phone support is managed through a system separate from other support channels. </p>
<p>Two distinct systems of record that don’t “speak” to each other—one for a call records (which only include phone and provides insights like average call time and number of calls each agent handles an hour) and a ticket record—make it impossible to gain comprehensive insights into all channels and plan accurately for the future. </p>
<p>Integrated phone support lets managers understand the performance of the entire channel mix, including:</p>
<li>What percentage of support tickets are through the phone
<li>Which types of issues drive phone calls vs. emails vs. chat, etc., enabling managers to strategize ways to reduce calls or divert support requests to other channels, reducing costs and improving efficiencies
<li>How to best train, hire, and distribute staff. If managers know they need more top-notch phone support agents, they can plan accordingly<br/>
<h3>Owners/IT - consolidate systems and reduce costs</h3>
<p>With integrated phone support—specifically a phone support solution that’s built into a customer support platform—IT is able to work with one trusted vendor for all support channels. Furthermore, phone support systems that integrate with other channels are typically VoIP solutions, which come with the additional benefits of reduced equipment and maintenance costs, portability and flexibility.</p>
<h3>Customers - better experiences</h3>
<p>The most important reason to adopt integrated phone support is because it’s better for customers. It allows companies to provide customers with exactly what they want: quick, consistent, personalized service.</p>
<p>First and foremost, customers want customer service to be fast. As mentioned earlier, the seconds can really add up when agents are forced to switch back and forth between different systems to reference interactions while on the phone with a customer. Integrated phone support means agents will have ready access to that information, leading to faster service. Integrated phone support means agents don’t have to keep customers waiting or worse, put them on hold while they search for information that straddles different systems.</p>
<p>Customers also want service from knowledgeable agents, and they want it to feel personal. When phone support lives in a silo, agents lack access to previous interactions with the customer and other context. But with integrated phone support, agents will not only know who is calling (thanks to CTI screen pops), they can also see if the customers has any outstanding tickets in other channels, previously closed tickets, purchase history, and more. All of which makes it easier for the agent to treat the customer like an individual. </p>
<h2>Selecting a vendor</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve made the decision to give your customers the best possible service with integrated phone support, here is a quick primer to help you choose the best vendor:</p>
<h3>Support platform integration</h3>
<p>Look for a phone system that fits into your agents’ workflows, complementing other channels. Agents should work from a single platform, and managers should have a full-view into support operations. Seek a telephony system that is built in to the support platform, limiting need for any custom integration work and reducing the number of software vendors.</p>
<h3>Inbound screen popping</h3>
<p>For inbound calls, receiving pop-up alerts with a link to the contact’s record in your CRM puts essential information at agents’ fingertips. This is especially useful for organizations focused on customer service and support so that you can provide a personalized experience. </p>
<h3>Customer history</h3>
<p>Contact details, including custom user and organization fields, as well as full multi-channel support history, should be at the agent's' fingertips during a call for easy reference. Knowing what other issues a customer may be facing leads to faster resolution and consistent cross-channel support.</p>
<h3>Automatic ticket creation</h3>
<p>It is essential that you choose something that keeps track of calls and voicemails with automatic ticket creation, eliminating the need for manual data entry. Plus, tickets can serve as a data source for quality assurance, agent training, and customer feedback.</p>
<h3>Call analytics</h3>
<p>Call activity reporting with real-time performance analytics and dashboards are essential to monitor productivity. You will also want to make sure that it is easy to do historical reporting and analysis across your channels. </p>
<h3>Call recording</h3>
<p>You should have the ability to record all inbound and outbound calls made from any device associated with the system. These recordings should be easily accessible directly in the contact record and easy to share with other agents for training and quality assurance. </p>
<h3>
Routing and automatic call distribution</h3>
<p>Ensure your phone support system will route callers to the right agent or department with routing tools like IVR (interactive voice response) systems and group routing. Round robin call distribution will ensure that calls are always routed to an available agent and evenly distributed among support team members.</p>
<h3>Flexibility & customization</h3>
<p>It’s important to seek a vendor that offers the flexibility to work with the systems you have in place and doesn’t require purchasing any additional software or hardware. It should be easy to customize for your team’s specific use cases and workflows, without the help of consultants or technicians.</p>
<h3>
Ease of use</h3>
<p>Since agents and managers will work with this tool for many hours at a time, it’s mandatory that you choose something that’s simple to use and designed with the user in mind.</p>

<p>One of the first challenges to providing great customer service over social media is determining where to focus time and resources. While marketing efforts may drive traffic to targeted social sites, customer service teams must meet their customers where they're already socializing. For most companies, Facebook and Twitter will be the primary focus for social care, but some brands may find that their customers also frequent Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, or other social sites.</p>
<p>To figure out where your customers are, search for mentions of your brand within popular social sites. Whether this is a first step toward creating a social media presence, or something your marketing department has already done, it is a mistake to leave dialogue about your brand solely to online commenters and the Google search algorithm.</p>
<p>If you find that customers aren't yet talking about your brand online, look for ways to include yourself in conversations relevant to your industry. The way to be welcomed into social conversations is to add something of value.</p>
<p>Because the consumer—not the brand—wields the most power over a brand's image on social media, the bottom line is that neglecting conversations that occur on sites like Facebook and Twitter can have staggering consequences. Conversocial reported that 88 percent of consumers are less likely to purchase from a company that leaves questions on social media unanswered.</p>
<h2>LISTEN TO WHAT YOUR CUSTOMERS HAVE TO SAY</h2>
<p>Many marketers are already familiar with social media monitoring tools that automate the process of searching for mentions of a brand name, or combing social media pages for specific keywords, but listening is equally important from a customer service perspective. What's more, many customers already believe that you are. When participants in a 2012 survey from Oracle were asked what was most important when visiting a company's social media page, 43 percent responded that they were looking for a direct response to their question, followed by 31 percent who expected direct access to customer service reps.</p>
<p>Depending on how much volume your brand's social media pages generate, it's important to collect and analyze customer activity so that you understand the kind of issues being raised over social media. Smaller companies may need to collect a week or month's worth of activity while larger companies can probably take a pulse over a shorter period of time.</p>
<p>Look at the information you've collected to determine:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many comments appear to be written in moments of frustration, perhaps after having a poor customer experience in person or online?</li>
<li>How many are technical or account-specific questions?</li>
<li>How many comments provide feedback, positive or negative?</li>
<li>How many questions can be answered using links to existing help content?</li>
<li>How many brand mentions require, or would benefit from, a response?</li>
<li>What time of day are your customers most active on social media?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions will help you plan staffing and resources, define priority criteria, make decisions about self-service options, and determine whether you'll be able to handle the majority of issues directly through the social channel or require a process for directing social customers to another line of support.</p>
<p>There are tools that automate the process of calculating volume and time, and can generate reports to provide you with a complete picture of customer demand. You may learn, for example, that the hours your customers are most active on social media do not align with your actual support hours.</p>
<h2>TRACK AND MANAGE VOLUME</h2>
<p>The size of your company and industry vertical will affect your social metrics. Some companies will see a lot of what amounts to "noise" via social media, and their challenge will be to sift through the noise to find the top priority contacts that require a response. Other companies will find that the majority of their contacts are direct requests for customer service. Depending on the volume of social interactions your brand generates, and the size of your staff, your ability to keep track of social inquiries (and your responses) may be made easier by a customer service platform that can integrate with social media and turn posts, tweets, and direct or private messages into tickets. In this way, you can easily triage, track, and escalate issues behind the scenes, yet still respond to the customer in the space where they have contacted you.</p>
<p>As a best practice, it's not necessarily wise to simply turn every social media mention into a ticket, either because your company's social media pages are so heavily trafficked that the volume becomes unwieldy, or because every interaction does not require a response (sometimes customers are perfectly adept at responding to each other). Still, what an integrated, multi-channel customer service platform can provide is context. The more you can see about a customer's history, the better. Are there open or prior conversations with this customer? Who did they interact with, and what was the outcome? Have they had this same issue before? Have they already tried reaching customer support through traditional channels or was Facebook their first line of defense? If you already have user data stored, agents can eliminate back-and-forth questioning for basic (or private) contact data.</p>
<p>In the fast-paced world of social media, speed of response is critical. Treating social media tickets like any standard ticket isn't going to be enough because customers expect a faster response. So, how can you define priority criteria? There's no single way to do it, of course, but here are a few suggestions:</p>
<p>Highest priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct technical or account-related questions</li>
<li>Complaints from dissatisfied customers</li>
<li>Service or product requests that are urgent</li>
<li>Issues (or outages) that affect many users or raise a potential PR crisis</li>
</ul>
<p>Items that are second-tier in priority are often opportunities to be proactive. You might consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responding to general references to your products or services</li>
<li>Thanking customers who provided positive feedback</li>
<li>Touching base with those who have made comments about your brand or industry that weren't necessarily targeted at you or requiring a response</li>
</ul>
<p>Smaller businesses without a need for a customer service platform might try one built specifically for social media ticket creation and management (rather than phone, email, and chat support) or, at the very least, utilize the private or direct messaging features of Facebook and Twitter to help create an archive of interactions with a customer.</p>
<h2>REPEAT THIS MANTRA: TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE!</h2>
<p>It's worth restating: speed of response is critical.</p>
<p>"Live help" typically refers to phone or chat support, yet in the customer's mind, social media is a gray area that more closely straddles the line between chat and email support. There is the potential for help to be instantaneous if social media is constantly monitored, but more likely, help will arrive hours later.</p>
<p>Several studies have found that the majority of customers expect a response over social media within the same day. That's pretty reasonable considering Edison Research reported that 42 percent of consumers who complained via social media expect a response within 60 minutes, and, according to the Oracle survey, more than half of Twitter users expect a response within two hours of tweeting at a company—both of which can be difficult service levels to meet, though some companies are beginning to.</p>
<p>One of the challenges to providing social care when you're not using the <a title="follow-the-sun" href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/provide-global-support/" target="_blank">follow-the-sun</a> model of support, is that tweets and timeline posts can languish overnight, driving your response time from just a few hours to 10-20 hours later.</p>
<p>As a best practice, always respond with immediacy—or with the promise of. This can be tricky without being able to send an email autoresponder, but one workaround is to prepare a boilerplate message catered to each social channel that lets the customer know you've seen their comment and that you're working on a resolution.</p>
<p>Speed isn't everything if you're not able to resolve the customer's issue. As a general guideline, if you can easily answer a question posed over social media in the space of a comment or tweet, and the answer can be public, then by all means, do it. But more important than providing an answer through the same channel it was asked, is providing a timely and correct answer. This might involve providing a first response over social media that moves the conversation to another channel of support.</p>
<h2>SOCIAL CARE IS CARE. PERIOD.</h2>
<p>The success of your social care efforts will depend, as ever, on the quality of care you provide, but you might want to pull out the kid gloves because providing great customer service over social media can require extra special handling. Agent responses must be timely, accurate, sensitive, brief, and friendly—a tall order.</p>
<p>Agents must respond quickly but not so fast that the issue isn't properly resolved. Agents must employ their <a title="soft skills" href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/customer-service-skills-2013/" target="_blank">soft skills</a> to read into a customer's emotional state and properly determine when the informal nature of social media, such as the use of smiley faces or emojis, are appropriate for conveying friendliness and willingness to help, or when a more formal statement of empathy or apology might be required before addressing the customer's issue.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue of length. Can or should the issue be resolved publicly, within the limited real estate of a comment or tweet? Is the agent trained in, or capable of, drafting custom replies without errors? Popular myth suggests that the young and tech-savvy are best equipped to handle social media, but some large companies have reported success using seasoned customer service agents, trained specifically for social media.</p>
<p>In general, all tenets of excellent customer service apply to social media. A great response will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correctly identify the customer's issue</li>
<li>Provide links to additional information</li>
<li>Close the loop (even to a "thank you" comment or tweet)</li>
<li>Include a personal touch, such as signing off with the agent's first name or initials</li>
<li>Be consistent across the organization, with regard to tone and response time</li>
</ul>
<p>Active use of a site like Twitter can be an acquired taste—and a learned skill. Consider hosting a "Lunch and Learn" or equivalent to cross-train your staff on social media usage and etiquette. Often at smaller or newer companies, there is overlap between marketing and customer service, but as companies grow, shared skill sets, best practices, and communication guidelines tend to break down and become siloed. Cross-training will ensure that your teams learn from one another, and that your brand message and integrity are upheld at every point of customer interaction.</p>
<p>Once agents are trained at responding over social media, they have the potential to be more efficient, handling four to eight times the number of contacts received through social media as they can by phone, according to a report by Gartner. In addition to improved efficiency, it was also reported that providing excellent social care helps to foster a deeper emotional commitment to your brand, directly impacting your Net Promoter Score.</p>
<h2>DETERMINE WHEN TO TAKE AN ISSUE "OFFLINE"</h2>
<p>Providing a public response to a question or complaint can go a long way. According to Conversocial, 95.6 percent of consumers are affected by other customer comments on a brand's social pages, and so it follows that consumers will also be affected by your responses to questions they see raised over social media.</p>
<p>When you gain or lose customers based on customer service, it adds up in dollars. The good news is that, as reported by Bain and Company, social media users spend 21 percent more when they experience excellent customer service.</p>
<p>But the reality is that not every contact over social media can be easily resolved in a single exchange (or in less than 140 characters), particularly if the issue is very technical or when the customer has many grievances to air. It can also be hard to know at the outset whether the customer will keep a thread going, cluttering your Twitter feed with @replies, so customer service reps must become adept at determining when to take a conversation from a public page to a private message, or perhaps off social media altogether—as well as when to bring the exchange back into the public sphere.</p>
<p>Generally, agents should move a conversation "offline"—in this case, off a timeline or feed/stream/profile—when:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are many back and forth replies, perhaps because the customer needs to answer a series of questions, or</li>
<li>sensitive personal data is required, such as email addresses, phone numbers, passwords, account or credit card numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>But how to do it? Sensitive information that can be quickly conveyed in writing may easily be sent in a private or direct message through the social media site. The following are based on a few real world examples of how one company used Twitter to request information, suggest another channel, and move a conversation into a private message:</p>
<blockquote><p>@Customer My sincerest apologies! I would be happy to look into this for you. Can you please follow us and DM me with your order #? ^SB</p>
<p>@Customer So sorry for those emails! If you need help w/ your email settings, don't hesitate to LiveChat us [bit.ly/link] ^SB</p>
<p>@Customer Apologies for the inconvenience! I just reached out to you via Facebook Message. Be sure to check your "Other" folder. ^SB</p></blockquote>
<p>One benefit to using a customer service platform that integrates both social and traditional channels is that you can use social media to let the customer know you'll send them the information they need by email, without having to request the customer's email address.</p>
<p>After an issue is resolved offline, it's important to return to the social channel and thank the customer for reaching out. Public interactions can be a double-edged sword, but the positive ones, when a customer has the chance to express gratitude for a great customer experience, is not the interaction to miss out on.</p>
<p>In our 2013 <a title="Omnichannel Customer Service Report" href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/omnichannel-customer-service-report/" target="_blank">Omnichannel Customer Service Report</a> we learned that customers default back to phone and email support in almost even numbers when they don't receive a response over social media. While that doesn't sound too bad, the report also found that 76 percent of conversations between customers and brands ended completely after the brand suggested the customer switch channels to either email or phone.</p>
<p>While building a social media support strategy, it's worth considering what might happen if you moved every social interaction "offline" or to another channel of support. Companies with limited staffing and resources might find that they must, and when done well, the customer will feel like they received a response over social media <i>and</i> had their issue resolved.</p>
<h2>LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE LEMONADE</h2>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We're all familiar with that old adage, "When life gives you lemons..." The well-known implication is that it's possible to turn around a less-than-hoped-for situation with a change in attitude. This is particularly useful advice when providing customer service over social media, given consumers' proclivity to use social media to grab a brand's attention. A recent survey by the Center for Services Leadership at Arizona State University, in conjunction with Customer Care Measurement & Consulting, found that 50 percent of consumers will complain to a brand about a bad experience, and that 35 percent of Americans are using Facebook, in particular, to complain about a shopping experience.</span></p>
<p>When this happens, everything depends on your response. Receiving negative feedback is an open invitation to rectify your brand's image and, more important, your relationship with the customer. The customer must feel like they've been heard and that you're willing to do what it takes to make them happy.</p>
<p>The following are some other things customer service reps might do to proactively to engage customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond even when the user hasn't directly tweeted at you or asked for help. Answering brand mentions or comments that don't require a response, but might benefit from one, shows you're paying attention.</li>
<li>Promote your customers by retweeting a happily resolved support interaction, or by "liking" helpful interactions that occur between customers. It's kind of like giving your customers a hug.</li>
<li>Give your customer service team a public face by introducing who's on duty and how long they'll be answering questions. Consider posting a team photo or an agent spotlight. It's nice to connect the face of the brand with the names behind it.</li>
<li>If feasible, follow up a resolved interaction with, "How is everything?"</li>
<li>Promote self-service. Think about introducing a support tip of the week and assigning it a clever, unique, and easy-to-remember hashtag, or designating someone to update your company's social media accounts when a new article has been added to your knowledge base or help center.</li>
</ul>
<h2>MIND YOUR P'S AND Q'S</h2>
<p>Whatever the social channel, there are a few ways to (publicly!) stick your foot in your mouth. The following are a few social media don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't neglect your customers. If you're going to provide customer service over social media, at minimum <i>every</i> direct support question should be answered.</li>
<li>Don't delete (or hide) comments or posts. The only exception is when comments are clearly spam or in violation of posted community guidelines. Deleting a customer's negative comment in order to preserve your virtual image will only further enrage the customer and damage the relationship.</li>
<li>Don't be defensive. It's important to remember that the customer, even when angry, has reached out to you. Thank them for bringing their issue to your attention, acknowledge their concern, and apologize for the trouble they are experiencing (even if you know it's self-wrought).</li>
<li>Don't engage with a customer whose intent is to simply argue and publicly defame your brand. Sometimes your best defense is silence and, after a certain point, they'll damage their own credibility more than your brand's reputation.</li>
<li>Don't overwhelm your customers with too much information, whether you're posting articles from a knowledge base or providing a too-lengthy response in a comment.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are, of course, always a few exceptions to the rule, and here's one of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't reply or respond to every customer in the event of mass issues or outages. When many customers are affected by a single issue, it's best to provide only public status updates that will reach everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regular monitoring of your company's social media pages combined with savvy use of the sites can elevate your customer service efforts from acceptable to exceptional. The better your social care, the more social traffic you can expect, and this is a good thing!</p>

<h1>Protect your IT Assets: Enhancing Patch and Asset Management with Integrated Ticket Management</h1>

<p>The consequences of overlooking even a single security vulnerability can be severe. If a computer on the enterprise network gets infected with malware, it can be expensive to fix, and may also prevent users from being productive while the problem is being addressed. Staying on top of security vulnerabilities and compliance requirements in today?s complex IT environments requires monitoring and management tools that can automate IT Service Management (ITSM) processes and increase visibility.</p>
<p>Traditionally, enterprise ITSM tools have been one of the most common ways to provide such monitoring and management capabilities. However, the cost of these enterprise management solutions is high both in terms of software licenses and the extra cost of specialized administrators and training needed to take full advantage of the tools. Some businesses have chosen to avoid these high costs by instead using point solutions for their most important ITSM needs and augmenting the tools with manual tracking and reporting methods. While this is a cost-effective way to enable some ITSM capabilities such as patch and asset management, it also puts a greater burden on IT support teams because of the manual steps involved.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the era of cloud computing has enabled a new approach to ITSM wherein best-of-breed tools can be used together at a fraction of the cost of traditional enterprise management frameworks. The cloud makes it easy to use multiple tools and to integrate them together, giving IT organizations the choice to deploy an industry-leading support solution along with other cloud-based ITSM tools such as patch and asset management. This avoids the high cost and increased complexity of an all-in-one ITSM tool, which would likely include capabilities that would never be used.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on how a cloud-based help desk solution can be deployed with a cloud-based patch and asset management tool to achieve the following business benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduced exposure to risk ? Proactive management of assets and an automated patch update process to help reduce the risk that security vulnerabilities will go unnoticed.</li>
<li>Greater efficiency ? The integrated approach saves time and resources through automated releases of patch updates. This is also accomplished with efficient communication to IT support teams through detailed hardware and software status information that can be encapsulated within <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/help-desk-software/additional-features/ticketing-system/">help desk tickets</a>.</li>
<li>Expedited issue resolution ? The help desk capability expedites resolution of security vulnerabilities that are identified via the patch and asset management tool. A help desk ticket can be automatically assigned, enabling a controlled measurable workflow and visibility of progress toward resolution.</li>
<li>Greater management control ? Managers can have real-time visibility into the types of vulnerabilities being exposed as well as the speed with which they are resolved. Audit and compliance requirements are also simplified through flexible reporting on status of assets, software licenses, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To manage IT assets and properly understand security risks, IT support teams need to have easy access to the latest configuration and status information for all of the organization?s desktops, servers, and laptops. In some cases, there are thousands of systems to monitor, making manual methods of tracking this information too inefficient to be practical.</p>
<p>IT support teams also need to work efficiently, and that requires real-time visibility into the following types of information for every system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Location and ownership or responsible party for all hardware components</li>
<li>Software components installed</li>
<li>Status of software licenses and maintenance contracts</li>
<li>Currently installed patch levels for the operating system and key software components</li>
<li>Latest security and update patches that have been made available from OS and application software vendors but not yet installed</li>
</ol>
<p>These capabilities can be provided by a cloud-based patch and asset management environment, but in most cases, this is not enough. The patch and asset management solution can identify vulnerabilities, but provides minimal oversight for their resolution. When patch and asset management is integrated with help desk capabilities, tickets are automatically created as soon as an issue is identified, enabling issues to be tracked with the kind of visibility and control that assures proper resolution.</p>
<h2>Why Integrate Help Desk with Patch and Aset Management?</h2>
<p>Unlike complex enterprise management tools that include many capabilities that IT support teams won?t use, the focused approach of integrating a cloud-based patch and asset management tool with a cloud-based help desk tool provides the visibility and control needed to stay on top of security vulnerabilities without the high cost for software licenses or the extensive training that is often associated with enterprise management solutions. Furthermore, a cloud-based approach means that organizations can pay for it from their operating expense budget rather than creating a justification for a capital expenditure. And finally, cloud-based ITSM solutions can be scaled quickly and cost-effectively as the IT infrastructure grows.</p>
<p><strong>Integrating a best-of-breed patch and asset management tool with your help desk solution enables a focused and comprehensive approach</strong>, giving IT support teams the ability to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manage and track devices, including whether the device is remotely accessing applications and data</li>
<li>Track patching on Microsoft Windows and applications, as well as third party software</li>
<li>Monitor a single view of status information that presents help desk ticket information and device status details in the same dashboard</li>
<li>Work remotely from mobile devices because the cloud-based dashboard offers access from any mobile device or desktop</li>
</ol>
<p>Managers can also use the help desk reporting capabilities to watch trends over time or to monitor for improvements after making process changes. For example, it may be useful to monitor trends in metrics such as the average number of outstanding issues, time to resolution, and number of high severity issues. Patch and asset management tools don?t generally provide visibility into aggregated data for monitoring trends, but help desk tools are designed to enable management oversight.</p>
<h2>Reducing Risk of Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>To keep security vulnerabilities under control and reduce risk, organizations need two different kinds of IT management capabilities. IT support teams need the right tools to identify security vulnerabilities, and a help desk workflow is needed to track and manage each issue so that vulnerabilities get fully resolved in a timely manner.</p>
<p>A best-of-breed tool for patch and asset management can simplify the process of identifying vulnerabilities because the tool is designed just for that purpose. For example, an automated scan can be run at regular intervals and set up to identify the following types of vulnerabilities and bring them to the attention of the IT support team via the help desk:</p>
<ol>
<li>Outdated software licenses</li>
<li>Systems that have missed patch updates</li>
<li>Software applications that have not been updated to the desired version</li>
<li>Overdue anti-virus scans</li>
<li>Systems without proper firewall protection or password/screensaver protection</li>
</ol>
<p>For maximum efficiency, it?s best if this kind of information can be presented graphically as illustrated in Figure 1. This allows IT support teams to quickly identify the most urgent issues and also easily find the equipment that needs attention.</p>
<p><img class="clear" style="padding: 0px;" alt="Patch and Asset Management" src="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/images/p-resources/whitepaper-protectingitassets-1.png"/></p>
<p>To illustrate how the combination of patch and asset management with help desk workflows can reduce risk, consider the following example. Suppose that a particular user?s system was powered off during a recent software update or was disconnected from the network and missed a patch update. When that system comes back online, the next patch and asset management scan would discover the problem and automatically notify an IT support team member.</p>
<p>Identifying the issue is a critical first step. However, ensuring timely and proper resolution requires that the security vulnerability be tracked within a help desk work-low. The automatic help desk ticketing system makes it easy for such vulnerabilities to be documented and provides a consistent process for managing their resolution.</p>
<p>As soon as a new vulnerability is detected, the ticket would be automatically logged for the IT support team to see within the help desk environment. In many cases, this happens before the user even knows something is wrong. Leveraging help desk workflows to manage issue resolution can help reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Providing greater visibility to IT executives and support teams regarding vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Making it easier for support teams to prioritize work according to the most critical business needs</li>
<li>Enabling automated actions that speed the response to vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Enforcing a consistent escalation process to help reduce average resolution time</li>
<li>Simplifying compliance and audit requirements by providing visibility into ticket history, conversations, and more.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, whenever a user notices that a system is behaving abnormally, or simply doesn?t work, a ticket can be generated by the user. Even though the user may not understand the issue, data can be automatically collected from the user?s system and forwarded with the ticket to help IT support teams pinpoint the exact problem.</p>
<p>Another example of how a combined solution helps reduce risk is by making it easier to manage software licenses, providing visibility and control over the use of unlicensed, unapproved, or unsupported software on user systems. If a user installs an unapproved software component on their desktop system, the new software component would automatically be detected by the patch and asset management tool and a warning would be immediately issued inside the help desk solution. This would result in a ticket that prompts the IT support team to act upon the issue quickly so that the vulnerability is short-lived.</p>
<h2>Improving the Efficiency of IT Support Teams</h2>
<p>In addition to reducing the risk of vulnerabilities, an integrated solution also helps IT support teams work more efficiently, thus reducing support costs. The proactive scanning of all assets within the organization enables IT support teams to cost-effectively monitor the environment with very little manual effort.</p>
<p>Detailed data about the incident can be automatically collected through agents installed on the user?s system, providing context and technical details that can be very useful to IT support teams. Crucial information such as the platform OS and version, user?s installed software applications, hardware information, and even a link to remote access control can give IT support teams a head start because they have immediate access to all the information they need as soon as they open the help desk ticket. In addition, the patch and asset management system can continue to collect more information after a ticket is logged. Thus if the status of a system changes after a ticket is created, the help desk environment can be automatically updated so that IT support teams can view the latest information right when a help desk ticket is opened.</p>
<p>Automated collection of device status information is especially helpful for user-initiated tickets. When users call a help desk hotline, they often lack a basic understanding of IT terminology and may have difficulty explaining the issue to IT. In many cases, the user may not even know what operating system or application versions they are running. An integrated help desk solution enables this information to be captured from the user?s system and can thus make communication easier for both users and IT support teams.</p>
<h2>Expediting Issue Resolution</h2>
<p>Once a help desk ticket is created, whether automatically or by a user, the ticket can be managed through a configurable automated workflow that helps speed up resolution and minimize risk. Using a help desk ticket aids and expedites resolution by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying an owner for each issue</li>
<li>Providing automatic escalation for issues that do not get addressed</li>
<li>Improving management visibility into how well IT teams are doing at resolving issues</li>
</ol>
<p>The help desk workflow makes it clear who is assigned to handle each issue and provides greater visibility for tracking progress on outstanding issues. If a help desk agent does not get to a ticket in time, the system can automatically perform an action to resolve the ticket or escalate the process.</p>
<h2>Integration in Action</h2>
<p>The capabilities described in this paper are not just a theoretical vision about the future. A cost-effective cloud-based integrated solution is available today from Zendesk and Panorama9. In fact, it is in use today at Ledarna, the Swedish Organization for Managers.</p>
<p>When Ledarna began to outgrow their homegrown internal IT support platform in 2009, they wanted to implement a cloud-based solution that would combine customer support with a patch management capability. Having had a positive experience using Zendesk for customer support, they took a look at Zendesk?s 100+ integrations and found Panorama9.</p>
<p>Here?s what Ledarna has been able to achieve using Zendesk and Panorama9 together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Average customer satisfaction rating: 98%</li>
<li>Average first response time: 41 minutes</li>
<li>50% of solved tickets are resolved in less than 24 hours.</li>
<li>Transformed support from ad-hoc scribbles on pieces of paper to a controlled, measurable workflow in Zendesk and Panorama9.</li>
<li>Measure and report on ticket management to place a ?price tag? on support services.</li>
</ol>
<p>The combined solution from Zendesk and Panorama9 includes an integrated dashboard where the latest information about help desk tickets is available along with status information for the IT assets. Thus there is no need for IT support engineers to flip back and forth between dashboards for accessing the information needed to resolve issues.</p>
<p><i>We are seeing enormous productivity benefits. We are getting more tickets from our users because it's more accessible for them to make requests. But we can solve tickets easier and faster because we have greater visibility on our users and infrastructure.</i> -Alex Tsarapatsanis, IT Technician, Ledarna</p>
<h2>How the Integration Works with Zendesk and Panorama9</h2>
<p>The Zendesk integration with Panorama9 is accomplished by using the notification feature in Panorama9 to automatically create a Zendesk ticket. For more information about the integration and how to set it up, please refer to the Zendesk getting started guide at <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/entries/21504966-panorama9-it-monitoring-asset-management-and-more" target="_blank">https://support.zendesk.com/entries/21504966-panorama9-it-monitoring-asset-management-and-more</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Technology advances with cloud computing have enabled a new approach to ITSM wherein best-of-breed point solutions can be integrated together with relative ease. The integrated cloud-based solution from Panorama9 and Zendesk provides greater efficiency in patch and asset management to reduce IT support costs while also reducing exposure to vulnerabilities.

<p>Phone support is the black sheep of today's multi-channel support world. Poorly trained staff, misguided processes, and confusing phone systems have all eroded the user experience. On the business side, legacy systems were complex, expensive, and took a long time (and a lot of help) to set up. These factors worked against small and midsize businesses, in particular, who need to be able to quickly scale as business expands.</p>
<p>Yet research continues to show that consumers often prefer the phone to other channels. A phone call makes consumers feel acknowledged, and it's a sure-fire way to get their problem resolved, faster. Still, many smaller and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) shy away from offering phone support.</p>
<p>The truth is that phone support is both a vital and practical part of a multi-channel support strategy. And advances in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology now make phone support both affordable and easy to manage.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll look explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>some of the common misconceptions people have about phone support</li>
<li>research that explains why phone support so important for SMBs</li>
<li>how easy it is to set up a <a href="/voice/call-center-software/virtual-call-center/">call center</a> using an integrated VoIP system</li>
<li>tips for training and coaching new phone support agents</li>
<li>the most important metrics to track to make your phone support effective</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why phone support gets a bad rap</h2>
<p>Many people have nightmarish stories about navigating an interactive voice response (IVR) menu, or being stuck on hold only to have the call dropped. The experience makes a liar of that soothing, upbeat voice assuring them that their 'call is very important.' While IVRs, hold music, and menus intend to help callers navigate support options, they often have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Add to these frustrations the fact that phone support is often outsourced. Staff at large call centers may not feel empowered to truly help customers, and may feel disconnected. The whole situation leaves consumers with a bad taste in their mouth.</p>
<p>Customer horror stories are exacerbated by old technology. A small or midsize business evaluating the potential of phone support just sees a poor user experience and difficult implementation. Phone support doesn’t seem worth it. In fact, phone support seems like a last resort.</p>
<h2>Go for quality, not quantity</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many large phone support organizations focus on minimizing downside rather than maximizing satisfaction, which is why phone support is often arduous. A <a title="McKinsey Quarterly article" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/maintaining_the_customer_experience" target="_blank">McKinsey Quarterly article</a> exemplifies this strategy through its findings at a wireless telecommunications provider. After rigorous analysis, the telecommunications provider considered raising service levels to the "delight breakpoint" or reducing them to just above the "patience threshold." Customer-lifetime-value economics pointed to the second option.</p>
<p>Yet for SMBs, which don't often encounter the same volume-related challenges that large organizations do, helping customers reach the "delight breakpoint" can be a powerful weapon in the fight for market share. Great service helps create brand advocates—loyal customers who evangelize a company's product(s) to others. Brand advocates help businesses grow without increasing sales and marketing spending. It’s a mistake a lot of companies make—under-investing in customer-retention spending. <a title="Research revealed" href="http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/7/18/customer_retention.html" target="_blank">Research revealed</a> that brands who increase customer retention rates by as little as 5% can increase profits by 25-95%.</p>
<p>In fact, <a title="a Deloitte study" href="http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/Consumer%20Business/US_CP_BrandAdvocatesStudy_020910.pdf" target="_blank">a Deloitte study</a> showed that brand advocates spend more than twice as much as regular consumers on average. In this way, providing exemplary service to an existing customer base can help small and midsize companies see a return on customer support investments.</p>
<p>Before you can create brand advocates, you must communicate with your customers on their channel of choice.</p>
<h2>Customers (still) prefer phone conversations</h2>
<p>In Forrester’s “Global 2011 Consumer Preference Report—Contact Centers” study, phone conversations trumped email interactions by a ratio of nearly three to one. To explain this, the study asked respondents to prioritize what they desired in a customer service interaction. Quick resolution and human interaction topped the list:</p>
<ol>
<li>"I am able to interact with a customer service representative quickly."</li>
<li>"My query is resolved quickly."</li>
<li>"I am able to interact with a person."</li>
<li>"I am able to access the information I need to resolve my query myself."</li>
<li>"The customer service representative is based in this country."</li>
</ol>
<p>The reasons provided by the respondents are perhaps the most revealing takeaway from this study, especially as time marches on and live chat, social media, and self-service options continue to evolve and claim larger (<a title="and fluctuating" href="http://www.avaya.com/usa/resource/assets/premiumcontent/The_Autonomous_Customer_Survey_2013.pdf" target="_blank">and fluctuating</a>) portions of the <a title="multi-channel" href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/a-guide-to-multi-channel-customer-support/" target="_blank">multi-channel</a> pie.</p>
<p>More recent findings confirm that <a title="voice is still the primary channel" href="http://blogs.forrester.com/kate_leggett/13-01-14-forresters_top_15_trends_for_customer_service_in_2013" target="_blank">voice is still the primary channel</a> for customer service, and findings from our internal <a title="Zendesk Customer Service Benchmark" href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/customer-service-benchmark/" target="_blank">Zendesk Customer Service Benchmark</a> in the third quarter of 2013 revealed that the phone actually yields the highest customer satisfaction rating. Compared with service provided via email, chat, web self-service, Twitter and Facebook, a whopping <a title="91% of customers were satisfied with service provided via phone" href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Zendesk_Benchmark_2013Q3.pdf" target="_blank">91% of customers were satisfied with service provided via phone</a>.</p>
<h2>How phone support should operate</h2>
<p>Effective phone support should be simple. Telephony systems should be intuitive, and help speed resolution. And operational efficiency requires a blend of well-trained, empowered staff using intelligent, well-designed tools.</p>
<p>Here's a look at how phone support should ideally operate:</p>
<p><strong>Calls are fielded in-house.</strong> Research shows that in-house employees are more knowledgeable, dedicated, and have less turnover than outsourced agents.</p>
<p><strong>Agents have resolution authority.</strong> Research also shows that empowering agents to make crucial decisions on their own speeds resolution and increases job and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Your phone system facilitates productivity.</strong> A phone system should have the following features or functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seamless integration with other channels</strong>: Syncs with a customer support platform to prevent data loss, to show agents past interactions, to automatically log call information in tickets or to attach call information to related tickets, including tickets generated from other channels.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to install</strong>: Up and running in minutes, not days, with no complicated hardware or outside help needed.</li>
<li><strong>Affordable</strong>: No setup costs, with commitment-free, pay-as-you-go billing.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic call routing</strong>: Routes calls to the next open agent so that customers don’t deal with confusing or complex menus.</li>
<li><strong>Voicemail</strong>: Allows customers to leave voicemails during off hours or when all agents are busy; voicemail messages should let customers know when they can expect a return call.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong>: Presents relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) in an easily digestible format.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Let KPIs drive decisions.</strong> Phone systems with a great reporting dashboard should give you call stats that allow you to tweak performance and spot trends.</p>
<p><strong>Collect customer feedback.</strong> It’s helpful to send out regular surveys that measure customer satisfaction and to invite feedback that will help you improve.</p>
<p>Phone support can and does operate this way for many SMBs—especially using new technology. It’s no longer an uphill climb to set yourself up for ideal operation.</p>
<h2>Implement a call center in minutes</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are four key steps to implementing phone support, detailed in the sections below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a phone system</li>
<li>Set up the system</li>
<li>Implement a trial period</li>
<li>Go live</li>
</ol>
<h3>Choose a phone system</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There are three main types of phone systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legacy</strong>: Analog phone systems delivered through traditional phone lines</li>
<li><strong>VoIP</strong>: Digital phone systems delivered via the Internet</li>
<li><strong>Integrated VoIP</strong>: VoIP systems that link to a customer service platform</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Legacy systems have historically involved expensive hardware and professional setup, and don't scale easily. VoIP systems are more flexible because of their web delivery, and don’t require any hardware beyond a computer and headset. However, traditional VoIP systems lack one key component: customer support software integration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Integrated VoIP systems work in tandem with customer service platforms by linking calls to customer data. Calls are logged in tickets and attached to customer profiles, making it easy to cross-reference a new call with all old conversations—whether they happened on the phone, via chat, or otherwise. Integrated VoIP systems also offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-browser or handset calling</strong>: Agents can take calls using either a computer and headphones, or an IP phone</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The system can adjust to changes in volume by adding or subtracting lines with minimal effort</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, you should be able to try a VoIP system for free, and with no up-front commitment.</p>
<h3>Set up the system</h3>
<p dir="ltr">With the right phone system, setup requires limited configuration and no outside help. You’ll want to establish:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Available hours</strong>: Start with your current business hours and evolve according to customer feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Hold message or music</strong>: It easy to start out with a simple, universal soundtrack and then adjust, if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum hold time before voicemail</strong>: As a starting point, two minutes is a good rule of thumb.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Focus on making the customer experience as simple and straightforward as possible. If you use menus, limit options to only those that are absolutely necessary for ensuring proper call routing. Let friends and employees test the process before pushing it live to customers.</p>
<h3>Start with a trial period</h3>
<p dir="ltr">It's important not to overwhelm support staff when trying phone support for the first time. We recommend a one-month trial period, divided into two-week phases.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Phase 1</strong> - Opt for a slow rollout to a handpicked set of customers. Begin by emailing them a short message about the new service. Use these first two weeks to ease staff into the support process (see the section on training and coaching below). Conduct weekly meetings to gather feedback. This feedback can help you tweak initial processes before the second phase.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Phase 2</strong> - In the second half of the trial period, take a closer look at volume and issue type using the system's reporting dashboard. Use this information to gauge staffing needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of the trial period is determining which customers you should support. This is a crucial decision that depends largely on business goals and product type. For example, consumer goods businesses typically support all customers via phone, whereas service companies may offer phone support to only a particular customer subgroup, such as those with billing issues, or more complex technical problems.</p>
<h3>Go live</h3>
<p dir="ltr">To take your phone support live, announce the new support option via email. Also ensure that the support number is posted on your website, and any relevant social media profiles, if voice support is available to all customers. It’s important to clearly communicate your support hours or to clarify the type of phone support you’re offering (e.g., billing inquiries only). Sometimes a new channel of support needs to be marketed before it gains traction, but it’s best to be prepared for a surge in volume once you go live. Zendesk saw a 40% increase in weekly calls after posting our support number on our site.</p>
<h2>Train and coach agents for success</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Taking calls for the first time can be nerve-wracking. Agents never know what a customer will say, and every call is different. That’s why the best way to train an agent for voice support is to take things slow. At Zendesk, new agents don’t answer calls for one to two months after they're hired.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once live, phone agents do a lot at once: actively listen, soothe customers, create tickets, and research answers—often at breakneck speed. Agents should feel confident before flying solo, so here are a few tips to help ease them in:</p>
<ul>
<li>New agents should receive standard onboarding and product training, followed by more intensive training on the tools required to provide support.</li>
<li>Before diving into phone support, agents must be adept at creating tickets, searching for product information, and using your customer service software. For this reason, it's a good idea to have phone agents begin with email support. This gives them time to learn, research, and dig into your product and tools. You want their online tasks to come as second nature as agents listen to customers.</li>
<li>Next, have agents listen in on calls and shadow other phone agents to see how they speak and respond to customers.</li>
<li>Always check in with agents before putting them on the phone and don’t push. It’s important the agent feels comfortable.</li>
<li>When the agent is ready, have them start by handling voicemails. Without the pressure of a live call, the agent can take time to listen and figure out what the customer needs. Then they can research the answer before returning the call. Someone with more experience should be listening or available to jump in with coaching or support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always give your agents the green light to put the customer on hold if they need more time to find an answer or to ask for help.</p>
<p>Once your agents are comfortable, give them the authority to make decisions. Trust agents to handle calls without having to put customers on hold to ask for a manager's permission or approval before continuing with a resolution.</p>
<h2>Stats you should be tracking</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Once support is live, it's important to track KPIs to ensure that everything is running smoothly and to detect troubling trends. The phone system's reporting dashboard should aid this process by keeping track of a few key stats, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Total call volume</strong> – Total number of calls in a given time period. Look out for drastic swings up or down. This is a signal that there might be a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Per-agent call volume</strong> – Total number of calls per agent in a given time period. Look out for parity across staff in the same role. This should remain consistent over time or increase slowly.</li>
<li><strong>Average call time</strong> – Average time agents spend on the phone across all calls. Aim to keep this low, while focusing on customer satisfaction. Quick is nice, but pleased is better.</li>
<li><strong>Average turnaround time</strong> – Average time it takes to resolve an issue. Generally, the faster, the better. Try to or exceed match other channels.</li>
<li><strong>First-call resolution rate</strong> – Percentage of issues resolved on the first call. Higher is better, but complex issues may necessitate multiple interactions—judge accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Abandonment rate</strong> – Percentage of calls abandoned before answering. This rate should be as low as possible. Lower the maximum wait time if abandonment rises, and work on speeding resolution by having staff ready to jump in and help out during times when this rate spikes. If you find it spikes with regularity, you may need to add additional staff.</li>
<li><strong>Average speed to answer</strong> – Average time agents take to answer a call (including hold time). Try to keep as low as possible. Voicemail should be set to trigger a few seconds after the average time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t be intimidated. If you’re unfamiliar with these stats, start slowly and use basic call volume and average call time to determine appropriate staffing levels. Then revisit the remaining stats in a few months, once you’re more comfortable.</p>
<h3>Ask your customers how you're doing</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The ultimate measuring stick for phone support is customer satisfaction, so whenever possible, find ways to gather feedback. Great phone systems and customer service software will provide a simple electronic feedback mechanism, but it may also be necessary to seek more advanced methods, such as callback or email surveys. Remember to ask your customers for improvement opportunities. Then, as trends emerge, prioritize and implement the suggestions that make the most sense for your business.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We live in a fast-paced, multi-channel world where customers expect an immediate response. Smaller companies have to compete with their larger competition, which underscores why phone support is an ideal tool for SMBs looking to increase customer satisfaction and drive word-of-mouth marketing. Thanks to advances in technology, it's now possible to lower your costs and to manage multiple channels from a centralized platform. And this, in turn, makes it possible for any business of any size to offer first-class support.</p>

<p>An internal IT department is an interesting place to work. You feel buffered from the front-lines of 'real' customer support, yet the systems you monitor and maintain often directly affect the experience of those external paying customers in some way. So, by giving the best support possible internally, you're helping to ensure great service and support to the end-customer, too.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, customers are the people who are paying for the product or service they're getting. For an internal IT team, those are the people who pay your salary and for the tools you use in your role. They're the decision-makers — the same people who agree on the service levels between IT and the rest of the organization. Users, on the other hand, are those people who use your IT services in the office every day, contacting you with issues that may be hindering their ability to do their jobs.</p>
<p>A great IT manager knows how to balance the needs of the paying customer against the needs of the users. They have to ensure network usability, meet the service level targets set by business units and roll out new projects, all without blowing the budget on staff and assets.</p>
<p>A great IT professional not only enjoys the puzzle of solving a problem; they care about their rep, too. And a great rep comes from good support interactions. When it comes to IT support, it stands to reason that the technical difference between the customer and the user matters little. They both deserve responsiveness and helpfulness.</p>
<p>At Zendesk, we believe your users are customers, too. It's true they're not paying for the service you're giving them, but their experience with your IT support team has a direct impact on your reputation — just like 'real' customers do. Zendesk gives you a fast and simple way of providing customer-centric IT support, but with all the power and flexibility of customized workflows and reporting. We've simplified traditional IT service management processes so you can focus on being the most personable and productive IT department, ever. And over the coming weeks, I'll be sharing some tips on how you can go about it.</p>
